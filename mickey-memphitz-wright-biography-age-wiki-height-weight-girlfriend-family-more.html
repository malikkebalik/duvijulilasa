He was once a student of music stars such as LA Reid, Jermaine Dupri, Mark Pitts, and Sean “DIDDY” Combs, seeking a career in the music industry at an early age. He’s currently working as one of Arista/Jive Records’ youngest music executives.</p><p>He is adored for introducing T-Pain, YoungBloodZ, and K. Michelle to the rappers. He is at the forefront of the recording industry. Personally, the label Hitz Committee Records owns Mickey. He lived a wonderful life as a famous artist at a young age.</p><p>While Mickey and his ex-wife have no hope of reconciliation, he still loves her and her daughter, Reginae. Seeing his Instagram posts wishing his ex-wife with heart-touching captions on her second daughter’s birth, one may tell he’s regretting a divorce from her.</p><p>Born on the 10th of December 1984. He is quite tall and has a height of 6 feet 1 inch while his weight is 76 kg approximately. He has kept himself in good shape and has body figure measurements of 34-33-34. Mickey has black colored eyes and the color of his hair is black as well.</p><table width=607><tbody readability=2><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td width=448>10th of December, 1984</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td width=448>54 Years</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Height</td><td width=448 readability=5>In Centimetres – 184 cm<p>In Feet and Inches – 6′ 1″</p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Weight</td><td width=448>In Kilograms – 76 kg<p>In Pounds – 167 lbs</p></td></tr><tr><td>Body Measurements</td><td width=448>34-33-34</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td width=448>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td width=448>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td width=448>9 (US)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Even though Mickey Memphitz is a professional rapper, he is more popular for his work in music production and has introduced some of the greatest artists in mainstream music.</p><p>He has earned a lot of wealth through his work as a music producer and has produced some of the highest-grossing albums. The total net worth estimated for Mickey Memphitz is $20 million US dollars as of now.</p><p>The 35-year-old rapper was born in Tennessee, USA, as Mickey Wright Jr. in 1984. Although Mickey has not spoken much about his family members, Mickey Wright Sr. was a code enforcement officer, Mickey Jr. is found openly sharing about his father.</p><p>Mickey’s father was violently murdered in his hometown, Memphis, in 2001 by a KKK associate, Dale V. Mardis, for nothing but a racially motivated reason. The killer of Mickey’s father was sentenced to life imprisonment for committing a horrific act of hate-filled crime in 2011.</p><table width=607><tbody readability=1><tr><td></td><td width=448></td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td width=448>Memphitz</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td width=448>Tennessee</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td width=448>Music producer, Rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Orientation</td><td width=448>Straight</td></tr><tr><td>School</td><td width=448>Whitehaven School</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>College</td><td width=448>Shelby State Community College</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td width=448>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td width=448>American</td></tr><tr><td>Home Town</td><td width=448>Tennessee</td></tr><tr><td>Fathers Name</td><td width=448>Name Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Mothers Name</td><td width=448>Name Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Brothers</td><td width=448>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td width=448>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Memphitz’s career in the music industry started with an Arista Records internship. He won the chance to host “The Deal” on BET, and soon started working with Jive Records. He is now their A&R Senior Vice President, and for signing musician, T-Pain, he is most widely known. He released his own label, Hitz Committee Music, as well.</p><p>After apparently pulling a gun on a Johns Creek car wash worker, Memphitz turned himself in five days. Jail documents from Fulton County say Wright was booked on charges of aggravated assault and armed robbery. Capt. Christopher Byers, the spokesperson for the Johns Creek department, reported that Wright turned himself in.</p><p>There is a sour history of Mickey Memphitz Wright in his relationships. His experience of dating dates back to 2011. In June 2011, he happily tied the knot with the reality TV star and blogger, Antonia ‘Toya’ Carter Wright. Toya had a daughter named <a class=wpil_keyword_link title="Reginae Carter" href=# data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Reginae Carter</a> at the time of her marriage to Lil Wayne.</p><p>From 2004 to 2006, she was married to Lil. Until 2016, the pair lived happily with their daughter. Yet they had problems with each other, having enjoyed their love life for five years. So they got divorced in July 2016, ending the dispute.</p><p>As of today, Toya, Mickey’s ex-wife, is married to Robert “Red” Rushing, owner of the 2 Commas clothing store and sports manager. In February 2018, together, they welcomed a daughter, Reign Ryan Rushing. Mickey has met someone to love in the wake of his secret emotions with the previous attachment. Since 2018, he has been dating a young Asian model named Ji Gwap.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=2.5><tr readability=4><td>Girlfriend</td><td width=481 readability=5>Antonia “Toya” Wright,<p>Ji Gwap</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ji-Gwap.jpg></p></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Divorced</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Wife</td><td width=481 readability=5>Antonia “Toya” Wright (Ex-wife)<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/toya.jpg></p></td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td width=481>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you a list of Mickey Memphitz Wright’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Actress</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>On Feb 12, Mickey went to Instagram to congratulate ex-wife Antonia “Toya” Wright on her second child.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2016, Toya and Mickey divorced each other.</li></ul><ul><li>They also had a lot of problems, including Mickey telling Toya to drop his last name and apologize later.</li></ul><ul><li>But it looked like things were finally getting back on track with that same message.</li></ul><ul><li>He’s staying at Moon Laundry at present.</li></ul><ul><li>He’s best known for signing T-Pain, the rapper.</li></ul><ul><li>Mickey also frequently shares photos on his social media posts with his loved ones.</li></ul><ul><li>He posted a photo of his parents hoping to remember his late father on Father’s Day on an Instagram page dated 17 June 2018.</li></ul><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2o7XOZ6ysZ52esKyx2GaknqWgnba1xoywqaKfmKl8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-d-net-worth-career-lifestyle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mike D Net Worth: Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./harold-ford-jr-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Harold Ford Jr Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
