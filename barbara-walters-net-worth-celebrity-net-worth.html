Barbara Walters died on December 30, 2022, at the age of 93. During her multi-decade career Walters hosted several television shows, including "20/20," "The View" (which she also created and produced), and the "ABC Evening News." Walters began her career as a writer and researcher for "The Today Show" in 1961 and became the show's co-host in 1974. She was the first woman to co-host an American news program, and in 1976, she became the first woman to co-anchor a network evening news program. Barbara is also known for her annual "Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People" special and has published 2 books, "How to Talk with Practically Anybody about Practically Anything" (1970) and "Audition: A Memoir" (2008).</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Barbara Walters was born Barbara Jill Walters on September 25, 1929, in Boston, Massachusetts. Her parents, Dena and Louis, were both Jewish, and Lou managed a Boston nightclub called the Latin Quarter before opening a chain of nightclubs in 1937. Lou was also a Broadway producer and Entertainment Director for Las Vegas' Tropicana Resort and Casino, so Barbara spent time around celebrities during her youth. Walters grew up with an older sister, Jacqueline, who was mentally disabled and passed away from ovarian cancer in 1985. She also had a brother, Burton, who died of pneumonia in 1932, when Barbara was very young.</p><p>The family moved a few times, and Barbara studied at Lawrence School in Brookline, Massachusetts, Ethical Culture Fieldston School and Birch Wathen School in New York City, and Miami Beach High School (where she received her diploma in 1947) in Florida. She then attended Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1951. Walters spent a year working for a small advertising agency before landing a job at NBC affiliate WNBT-TV, where her duties included writing press releases and producing a children's program called "Ask the Camera." After leaving WNBT-TV, she produced the Eloise McElhone Show on WPIX until its cancellation in 1954, then went on to write for "The Morning Show" on CBS the following year.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 1961, Walters joined NBC's "The Today Show," starting out as a writer and researcher, then covering lighter-fare stories and the weather as the show's "Today Girl." She soon became a reporter-at-large and got to develop, write, and edit her own interviews and reports. After host Frank McGee died in 1974, Barbara officially became the first female co-host of "The Today Show." From 1971 to 1976, she also hosted "Not for Women Only," which aired after "The Today Show" on a local NBC affiliate. Walters co-anchored the "ABC Evening News" from 1976 to 1978 and has said that co-anchor Harry Reasoner visibly displayed his disdain for her on air. In 1979, Barbara joined ABC's "20/20," reuniting with <a href=# title="Hugh Downs Net Worth">Hugh Downs</a>, who she had worked with on "The Today Show."

Walters was married to Lorimar Television CEO <a href=#>Merv Adelson</a> from 1981 to 1984 and 1986 to 1992. In college, she dated lawyer Roy Cohn.

And in 2007, Walters dated Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning gerontologist Robert Neil Butler.</p><p>In 2010, Walters took 6 months off from "The View" and "Here's Barbara," her Sirius XM show, to recover from open heart surgery; she had been suffering from aortic valve stenosis and a faulty aortic valve needed to be replaced. The surgery was a success, and Barbara returned to both jobs in September. She retired from both shows in 2014.</p><p>Barbara Walters passed away in her home in Manhattan on December 30, 2022, at the age of 93 after suffering from dementia in her later years.</p><h2 id=awards-honors><strong>Awards and Honors</strong></h2><p>During her impressive career, Walters has been honored with many awards, including the Overseas Press Club's highest award, the President's Award, the Lowell Thomas Award for a career in journalism excellence, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Women's Media Foundation, and the Muse Award from New York Women in Film and Television.
