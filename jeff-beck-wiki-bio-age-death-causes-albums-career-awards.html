Since his childhood, he had started loving the guitar. In an interview a few years back, he stated that the electric guitar piqued his interest. It was before he even understood the difference between an electric and an acoustic guitar. For Jeff, the electric guitar appeared to be a very intriguing wooden plank with all those knobs and switches. Even before he knew how to play the guitar, Beck knew that he had to have an electric guitar.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.pitchfork.com/photos/63bf313bca531999b4530a49/master/pass/Jeff-Beck.jpg alt="Jeff Beck, Grammy-Winning Guitarist, Dies at 78 | Pitchfork" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When Beck was six years old, he heard Les Paul perform “How High the Moon” on the radio for the first time. That caught his attention and he inquired about it to his mum. Then, at the age of ten, Beck participated in a church chorus. Les Paul was the first electric guitar player who made an impression on Jeff.</p><p>However, Lonnie Mack was that one rock guitarist who had a huge influence on him among many others. After he grew up a little, he also tried building his own guitar. He would glue and bolt together cigar boxes for the body and an unsanded fence post for the neck with model aircraft control lines and frets. When he finally wanted to learn the guitar and he didn’t have one, He used to borrow it from others and then start learning.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Jeff_Beck_Education_and_family></span>Jeff Beck Education and family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jeff Beck was born to a British couple named Ethel Beck and Arnold Beck. We don’t have much intel on what did they use to do but we did find out that they had a comfortable living. Jeff’s parents always supported him and encouraged him to learn and play guitar. Furthermore, Beck grew up with another one of his siblings. He had an elder sister named Annetta Beck. When they were both teenagers, it was his sister Annetta, who introduced Jimmy Page and his songs to Beck.</p><p>Beck’s parents had enrolled him in Sutton East County Secondary Modern School to complete his basic high school education. Later, when he graduated from there, he also attended Sutton Manor School for some years and completed his graduation. After that, Jeff enrolled himself in the prestigious Wimbledon College of Art and completed his studies for three years. Furthermore, after getting out of college, he then started working as a painter and decorator, a groundskeeper on a golf club, and a vehicle paint sprayer for a short time.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2023%2F01%2F11%2FJeff-Beck-011123.jpg" alt="Jeff Beck dead: Legendary guitarist was 78 | EW.com" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Geoffreys_Glorious_Career></span>Geoffrey’s Glorious Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Beck first gained popularity when he joined the Yardbirds and started performing with them. Later, he decided to lead the Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice. Jeff started to cover a variety of genres, that included blues rock, hard rock, jazz fusion, and a fusion of guitar-rock.</p><p>Soon, people started to recognize him and love his songs from all over the world. Beck was listed as number five on the list of the 100 best guitarists that was published by Rolling Stone. He was given the honorable nickname and was referred to as a “guitarist’s guitarist.” He was also named as “one of the most important lead guitarists in rock” by Rolling Stone publications.</p><p>Eventually, Jeff started to gather praise from all around the world. Praised by critics, Beck won six Grammys for doing the best rock instrumental performance and one for best pop instrumental performance. He was also honored with the Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music by the British Academy in 2014. As a member of the Yardbirds and as a solo performer, he was given one of the highest honors of being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Becks_Marriages_and_Wives></span>Beck’s Marriages and Wives<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jeff Beck married Patricia Brown as his first wife in 1963. Since Brown was not well-known, nothing is known about her personal or professional history. Beck, was only 19 at the time of their wedding and both the newlyweds were very young. Brown and Beck were together for more than five years. However, they decided to split up in 1967. They did not have any kids together.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/crop-21005909.jpg alt="Who is Jeff Beck's wife Sandra Cash? | The Sun" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After divorcing Brown, Jeff was a single man for more than three decades before he married his second wife Sandra Cash.
