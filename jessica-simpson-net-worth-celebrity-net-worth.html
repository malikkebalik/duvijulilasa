Much more details on her retail empire and earnings later in this article.</p><p>Jessica Simpson burst into the collective conscious as a pop starlet during the years that also launched the careers of <a href=# title="Britney Spears Net Worth">Britney Spears</a>, <a href=# title="Christina Aguilera Net Worth">Christina Aguilera</a>, <a href=# title="Mandy Moore Net Worth">Mandy Moore</a>, and a few other, now forgotten, pop starlets.&nbsp; It was almost impossible not to turn on the television and see one or the other of the young women strutting their stuff on an awards show, performing at a large event, or appearing in a music video.&nbsp; Each performer had something that set them apart from the others.&nbsp; Britney had sex appeal and dance skills.&nbsp; Christina had sex appeal and a powerhouse voice.&nbsp; Mandy Moore had a simultaneously wholesome, yet slightly naughty, vibe that she parlayed into a moderately successful film career.&nbsp; She has since focused on folk music instead of pop.&nbsp; Jessica Simpson, perhaps quickly realizing that she was not going to be able to maintain the same level of pop/performance success as her peer group, quickly focused her energies on becoming a reality celebrity.&nbsp; Her reality series, with then husband, fellow pop star, Nick Lachey, was immensely popular. The show ended when the marriage ended.&nbsp; She also launched an acting career, appearing in such movies as "The Dukes of Hazzard", "Employee of the Month", and "Blonde Ambition".&nbsp; In 2004, she launched a line of edible perfume and cosmetics.&nbsp; She then created the "Jessica Simpson Collection", a line of handbags and shoes she designed herself.&nbsp; She launched an online beauty products site soon after, and then an intimates line.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-244810 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/GettyImages-484687953.jpg alt width=594 height=462 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-244810 class=wp-caption-text>David Buchan/Getty Images</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jessica Ann Simpson was born in Abilene, Texas, on July 10, 1980. Along with her younger sister Ashlee, she grew up in Dallas and Waco, Texas. She dropped out of high school in 1997 when her career began taking off, earning her GED via distance learning at Texas Tech high school a year later.</p><p>As the daughter of a Baptist youth minister, Simpson was raised with a strong Christian faith. She began singing in the church choir as a child, and it was at a church retreat that she realized she wanted to pursue a career as a singer.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>At the age of twelve, she auditioned and was selected as a semi-finalist for "The Mickey Mouse Club", although she ultimately was not selected. After resuming her singing in church, she was discovered and signed by the head of Christian music label Proclaim Records. Her debut album "Jessica" was unreleased, as the company went bankrupt, but her grandmother funded a limited pressing of the record. Simpson landed a record deal with Columbia records, after "Jessica" was sent out to multiple labels and producers and she caught the eye of Columbia Records head <a href=# title="Tommy Mottola Net Worth">Tommy Mottola</a>.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-262793 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Jessica-Simpson.jpg alt width=594 height=394 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-262793 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Mottolla wanted Simpson to focus on an "anti-sex appeal" wholesome image, to contrast against the public images of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. Her debut single "I Wanna Love You Forever" (1999) performed well, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, and was certified platinum by the RIAA. Her debut studio album "Sweet Kisses" was released November 1999, and earned a double platinum certification by the RIAA. Her second album "Irresistible" (2001) was less successful.</p><p>After wedding boyfriend Nick Lachey in October 2002, Simpson and Lachey starred in the MTV reality show "Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica," which was a popular hit. Simpson's third studio album "In This Skin" was released the day of the show's premiere, with the show helping to promote the record. Following disappointing sales, Simpson recorded new material and re-released "In This Skin" in 2004 with better results, selling over 4 million copies in the US.</p><p>In March 2006, Simpson parted ways with Columbia Records, and signed on with Epic Records. Her fifth studio album "A Public Affair" was released in 2006, and debuted at number five on the Billboard 200. For her sixth album, "Do You Know" (2008), Simpson attempted a transition into country music which not generally not well received. Additionally, Simpson has two holiday albums, "ReJoyce: The Christmas Album" (2004) and "Happy Christmas" (2010).</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-294491 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jessica-Simpson1.jpg alt="Jessica Simpson Net Worth" width=900 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-294491 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Frank Micelotta/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=acting-television-pursuits><strong>Acting and Television Pursuits</strong></h2><p>In addition to her own reality show with then-husband Nick Lachey, "Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica", Simpson also appeared on her sister's show "The <a href=# title="Ashlee Simpson Net Worth">Ashlee Simpson</a> Show" in 2004. She made her film debut in "The Dukes of Hazzard" (2005), which grossed over $111 million worldwide despite negative reviews. Her second film, "Employee of the Month" (2006) was a commercial failure. Other films she's starred in include "Blonde Ambition" (2007) and "Private Valentine: Blonde and Dangerous" (2008). Additionally, Simpson hosted the VH1 documentary series "The Price of Beauty" (2010), and appeared as a mentor on television series "Fashion Star" (2012-2013). She reprised the role of Daisy Duke for an episode of "Funny or Die Presents" in 2014, and she made a cameo in "Ashlee + Evan" (2018) and lent her voice to an episode of "Duncanville" (2022).</p><h2 id=entrepreneurial-ventures><strong>Entrepreneurial Ventures</strong></h2><p>Outside of music, Jessica is an extremely successful entrepreneur. She has launched a line of beauty products and, handbags, lingerie, shoes and boots that are sold primarily on the Home Shopping Network. One of Simpson's earliest ventures was her Jessica Simpson Desserts by Jessica Simpson edible cosmetics line with Randi Shinder in 2004, followed in early 2005 by her Dessert Treats edible cosmetics line targeted towards a younger audience. Both lines were canceled following a series of lawsuits.</p><p>Following her 2011 pregnancy announcement, Simpson signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Weight Watchers in 2012 to use their diet plan to shed her pregnancy weight, filming several television commercials for the company. She also launched a maternity clothing line in 2012, as well as a perfume inspired by motherhood, "Vintage Bloom".

At inception she partnered with the Camuto Group to manufacture brands that carried her name. The Camuto Group, which was founded by Nine West co-founder <a href=# title="Vince Camuto Net Worth">Vince Camuto</a>, had built an empire manufacturing shoes for brands such as <a href=# title="Tory Burch Net Worth">Tory Burch</a>, Dillard's, BCBG and <a href=# title="Max Azria Net Worth">Max Azria</a>.</p><p>Jessica and Camuto collaborated on the development of a high-heeled cowboy boot for women which featured a red heel and coincided with Jessica's appearance in the 2005 film reboot of "The Dukes of Hazzard."</p><p>In addition to selling a master licensing agreement, Jessica also sold Camuto 25% of her brand. The master license gave Camuto first right to manufacture all retail products for Simpson, not just shoes. The partnership eventually produced everything from shoes to perfume and lingerie.</p><p>By 2010 The Jessica Simpson Collection was generated $750 million per year in gross revenue. At its peak in 2014 it topped $1 billion in gross revenue. In 2021 the brand generated $500 million.</p><p>During the Camuta era, Simpson typically earned a little over 1% of the brand's gross revenue. So in a year when the brand generated $750 million, she earned $9.75 million. In the year the brand generated $1 billion in gross sales, she earned $13 million.</p><p>Many publications have called Simpson a "billion dollar celebrity", referencing the billion dollar sales performances of her retail empire. She is not personally worth $1 billionâ€¦yet!</p><p>In April 2015 Jessica sold 62.5% of her 75% stake in the brand to a company called Sequential Brands for $117 million. Vince Camuto's widow remained 25% owner and Jessica after the deal continued to own 12.5%.</p><p>After COVID-19 decimated Sequential's business at large, the company was forced to file for bankruptcy in February 2021. Thanks to a clause in her initial contract with Sequential, the company could not sell her brand without her approval. That meant other buyout offers could be considered but none could be accepted without Jessica's approval. That essentially made Jessica the only viable buyer in bankruptcy.</p><p>In August 2021 Jessica, working with an investment bank to help with financing, paid $65 million to reacquire her brand with a bankruptcy judge's approval.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-294490 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jessica-Simpson2.jpg alt width=900 height=592 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-294490 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Mark Mainz/Getty Images for IMG)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Simpson met singer <a href=#>Nick Lachey</a> at a Christmas party in 1998, and the two wed on October 26, 2002. After announcing their separation in November 2005, Simpson filed for divorce in December 2005, finalized in June 2006. Because Simpson had not signed a pre-nuptial agreement, she reportedly had to pay Lachey $12 million in their divorce.</p><p>She began dating retired NFL player <a href=# title="Eric Johnson Net Worth">Eric Johnson</a> in May 2010, and the couple became engaged in November that same year. They married in July 2014 and have three children together.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>Simpson's primary residence is a large mansion in Hidden Hills, California which she bought from Ozzy and <a href=# title="Sharon Osbourne Net Worth">Sharon Osbourne</a> for $11.5 million in 2013. The Osbournes bought the house for $12.5 million in 2007, so it was a relative bargain. Over the years, Simpson her husband have done extensive remodels to the 2.5 acre property, which features six bedrooms, a basketball court, playground and large pool. Today this property is worth $15 â€“ 20 million based on comparable recent sales. Prior to buying in Hidden Hills, Simpson owned a home in Beverly Hills that she bought in 2005 for $5.265 million. She sold this house in October 2013 for $6.4 million.</p><p></p><h2 id=jessica-simpson-a-billionaire><strong>Is Jessica Simpson A Billionaire?</strong></h2><p>Outside of music, Jessica is an extremely successful entrepreneur. She has launched a line of beauty products and, handbags, lingerie, shoes and boots that are sold primarily on the Home Shopping Network. Her combined retail empire is expected to become the first celebrity brand to achieve over $1 billion in annual sales. This last achievement has been the source of a common misconception about Jessica Simpson's net worth. When this billion dollar sales estimate was announced, several magazines ran headlines that called Jessica a "billion dollar celebrity". Many of Jessica's fans have miss-interpreted this headline to mean that Jessica is personally worth $1 billion which unfortunately is not trueâ€¦ But if she stays on this pace, it might be true soon enough!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyrsdKsoJyZXai2rrzSqKVmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./miley-cyrus-has-a-nodule-on-her-vocal-cord.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Miley Cyrus has a nodule on her vocal cord</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./andrea-brillantes-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Andrea Brillantes Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
