In fact, Kudrow was tapped to play Roz Doyle on&nbsp;Frasier&nbsp;before she was fired from the series before it taped its pilot episode. Kudrow also appeared on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheers</a>&nbsp;before she was axed from the show’s spinoff.</p><h2>Lisa Kudrow was fired from&nbsp;Frasier&nbsp;after initial rehearsals</h2><p id=par-2_64>In the early 1990s, Kudrow was originally cast as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roz Doyle</a>, the producer for Dr. Frasier Crane’s talk radio show. Kudrow had beat out Peri Gilpin for the role, but it became clear that Kudrow didn’t have the right personality for the part during rehearsals. The series’s creators were looking for a character who would challenge Frasier, and Kudrow’s breezy delivery didn’t fit the bill.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lisa-Kudrow-1.jpg><p id=par-3_53>She was let go from the show, and Gilpin was brought back in to fill the spot. Gilpin’s portrayal of Roz was much more hard-hitting and sarcastic, which played off of Frasier perfectly. Gilpin portrayed Roz for all 11 seasons of&nbsp;Frasier&nbsp;and could return to reprise her role in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a reboot of the famed series</a>.</p><h2>Kudrow appeared in&nbsp;Cheers&nbsp;before being hired for&nbsp;Frasier</h2><p id=par-4_58>Several main characters from&nbsp;Frasier&nbsp;appeared in different roles on&nbsp;Cheers. Gilpin, for example, appeared in&nbsp;Cheers&nbsp;as a journalist who was sent to interview Woody Boyd in the show’s 11th season.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John Mahoney</a>, who portrayed Martin Crane for 11 seasons, also appeared in the final season of&nbsp;Cheers. If you watch closely, you may notice that Kudrow made an appearance in the series, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Frasier-Cast.jpg><p id=par-5_50>Kudrow appeared in season 8 of&nbsp;Cheers&nbsp;as Emily, a woman cast alongside Woody in a community theater production of&nbsp;Our Town. Kudrow’s guest spot only lasted for one episode, and it’s a little difficult to spot her. Her signature blonde hair was dark brown during the episode, but her voice is unmistakable.</p><h2>Kudrow landed the role of Phoebe shortly after being booted from&nbsp;Frasier</h2><p id=par-6_36>Kudrow may have been fired from&nbsp;Frasier, but she rebounded rather nicely. Shortly after being axed from the sitcom, she was cast in&nbsp;Friends.&nbsp;Frasier&nbsp;aired its first episode in September 1993. Almost exactly one year later,&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;premiered its first episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Friends-cast.jpg><p id=par-7_66>In&nbsp;Friends, Kudrow played the flighty and sweet but street-smart Phoebe. The role ended up being so iconic that it defined Kudrow’s career. Initially, her part on&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;was supposed to be minor, though. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Comedy Central</a>, Chandler Bing and Phoebe were originally written as secondary characters and were not going to be included in main storylines. Both were added to the main cast before the first season aired.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSzs7XEp5usZaOprrN5y6KqmmWbqrGzu9ZmmKmolZa%2FprCMqKVmm5iasrO%2FjJucn6eimnqtrc2doKefXZa7pXnLqKqippdirm6%2BzqWcZqeeYrOzrdKinKtmmKm6rXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-do-i-remove-the-top-rack-on-my-ge-adora-dishwasher.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How do I remove the top rack on my GE Adora dishwasher?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-plants-repel-wasps-and-hornets.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What plants repel wasps and hornets?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
