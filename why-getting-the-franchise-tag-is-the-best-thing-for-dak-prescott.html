The Cowboys gave running back <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezekiel Elliott</a> a six-year, $90 million deal just before the season started, and wide receiver <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amari Cooper</a> scored a five-year, $100 million contract earlier this month. It seemed certain Prescott would follow suit.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Instead, the two sides remained far apart in contract talks, and the Cowboys slapped the franchise tag on Prescott. And it just might be the best possible outcome for the quarterback.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>A franchise tag locks a player into a one-year contract, so normally it's not a good deal for a player looking for a long-term deal with lots of guarantees. Prescott's case is unique, though.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For one, he'll make $31.6 million on the tag alone, which is already a lot more than his current salary. He could even take the path of <a href=# title="Kirk Cousins Net Worth">Kirk Cousins</a> and play back-to-back seasons under the tag, giving him about $70 million over the next two years.&nbsp;</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295830 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-845437482.jpg alt width=900 height=641 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295830 class=wp-caption-text>Tom Pennington/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Prescott would then hit free agency in 2022 as a 28-year-old quarterback (presumably) still in his prime. That's a year younger than Cousins was when the Minnesota Vikings gave him an $84 million deal that was fully guaranteed. Cousins just signed another deal this week for $150 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If Prescott goes the two-year franchise tag route, he'd very likely surpass $200 million by 2024. If he, like Cousins, only signed a three-year deal, he would only be 31 when that first deal ended. That would set him up to sign another massive contract, which would be dictated by the quarterback market.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In fact, that's one of the biggest reasons Prescott and the Cowboys haven't agreed to a new deal yet. The Cowboys have reportedly offered their quarterback a contract worth more than Philadelphia's <a href=# title="Carson Wentz Net Worth">Carson Wentz</a> and Los Angeles's <a href=# title="Jared Goff Net Worth">Jared Goff</a>. Wentz signed a four-year, $128 million deal with $109.2 million guaranteed. Goff's four-year, $134 million contract includes a record $110 million guaranteed.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Prescott wants a four-year deal and the Cowboys want to sign him for five years. A four-year contract would put Prescott back into free agency in 2023, after guys like <a href=# title="Patrick Mahomes Net Worth">Patrick Mahomes</a> and DeShaun Watson have signed their mega-deals.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However Prescott looks at it, he's going to get paid. His rookie deal was worth $2.7 million over four years. Even if he stays franchised for this season, he'll make more than ten times his entire rookie contract.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Cowboys have until July 22 to sign Prescott to a long-term deal or he'll play 2020 under the franchise tag. And with quarterback prices continuing to rise – and more deals yet to come – Prescott should be thrilled with the possibilities.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjrCfsmWXmsG1tc2gZK2glWKzs63NnJ%2Biq5ViwaKzjKKqZqyYmnqjsdKtZK2gmaO0brLOq2SdmZtivbOx0pymraxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./an-unlikable-character-actually-had-1-of-the-saddest-deaths-on-the-show.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>An Unlikable Character Actually Had 1 of the Saddest Deaths on the Show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-in-the-family-of-connor-from-love-on-the-spectrum-meet-his-mother-sister-and-brother.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is in the family of Connor from Love on the Spectrum?
