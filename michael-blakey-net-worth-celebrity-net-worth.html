His watch and car collections are purportedly worth tens of millions of dollars. He also uses his channels to tour luxury home listings primarily around Los Angeles. His realty review videos have become popular enough where he is frequently approached by realtors to give promotion to a home they are trying to sell.</p><p>He has courted some controversy by implying ownership of a private jet. Some followers have alleged that he does not own actually own a jet and merely uses demonstration planes to inflate his image. In one specific video he drives a Ferrari to a private airport to tour an Embraer Praetor 600 private jet that he reported to own. Before customizations this jet would cost $21 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97z6umna2Tmr%2B0e8yimqGZlaF6o7jApJyyZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./morgan-fairchild-net-worth-how-much-does-the-actress-earn.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Morgan Fairchild Net Worth: How Much Does the Actress Earn?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./marc-bulger-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Marc Bulger Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
