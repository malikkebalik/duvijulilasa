Over the years, it’s received renewed attention, especially surrounding the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dramatic reboot on Peacock</a>. Looking at the original cast of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>, here’s a breakdown of everyone’s current net worth. And we’ll look into who made the most from the show, which might be surprising to fans.</p><h2 id=h-the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-cast-s-net-worth>‘The Fresh Prince of Bel Air’ cast’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fresh-prince-bel-air-cast-net-worth.jpg><p id=par-2_57>Diving into the current roster of the cast’s net worth, it’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best to start with Will Smith</a>. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Smith is estimated to be worth $350 million in 2022. Fellow rapper DJ Jazzy Jeff, who played Jazz, is worth $5 million. Here’s how Celebrity Net Worth breaks down the remaining cast members, based on 2022 data.</p><p id=par-3_42><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Marcell</a>, who played Geoffrey, is worth $2.5 million. Janet Hubert played the first Aunt Vivian Banks and left the show in 1993 and is worth roughly $500,000. Aunt Viv’s replacement was Daphne Reid, and she’s reported to be worth $2 million.</p><p id=par-4_41>The late James Avery played Philip Banks and was worth $3 million at the time of his death. Tatyana Ali played Ashley Banks and is said to be worth $6 million.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Karyn Parsons played Hillary Banks</a>&nbsp;and continues to be worth $1.5 million.</p><p id=par-5_28>Finally,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alfonso Ribeiro</a>, as the iconic sweater-wearing and swivel-dancing Carlton Banks, is reported to be worth $7 million. Ross Bagley, who came in as Nicky Banks, is worth $400,000.</p><h2 id=h-how-much-did-everyone-make-from-the-show>How much did everyone make from the show?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_47><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a>&nbsp;reported that Will Smith made $2.8 million across the show’s first three seasons. Unsurprisingly, out of all the cast members, Smith made the most from the show. Unfortunately,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he owed so much in back taxes</a>&nbsp;from his rap career that he didn’t get to pocket much of those earnings.</p><p id=par-7_65>And while most of the original show’s actors earned the most Hollywood cred because of their roles, their wealth predominantly started there. Some fell off,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including Hubert</a>, the first actor to play Aunt Viv, who reportedly got fired for breach of contract when she got pregnant. Her acting career has stalled since. Others, like Ribeiro, did moderately better in the years since&nbsp;Fresh Prince&nbsp;went off the air.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-the-new-cast-compares>How the new cast compares</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_44><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Things</a>&nbsp;outlines how much each of the new cast members is worth and earnings based on the new reboot,&nbsp;Bel-Air. Jabari Banks took on Will Smith’s role, and he’s worth between $100,000 and $125,000. Olly Sholotan, who plays Carlton, is reported to be worth $150,000.</p><p id=par-9_61>Jordan James’ who plays Jazz, is a bit of an unknown in terms of net worth, with The Things suggesting anything between $100,000 to $1 million. Coco Jones portrays Hilary and is worth roughly $1 million. Akira Akbar is worth $1-$3 million and will play Ashley. Cassandra Freeman will play Vivian Banks and is reported to be already worth $1.9 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMn6meq5hivbO1zZycZqeWYq%2BmuIyaoKtlk5bAtXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5wKebZq%2BYpHqurcOeZK2glWK6sL%2FTZp2rp51iwamxjKyfqK9encGuuI4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./17-bold-sagittarius-season-2023-nail-art-design-ideas.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>17 Bold Sagittarius Season 2023 Nail Art Design Ideas</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./which-lead-actor-has-the-highest-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Which Lead Actor Has the Highest Net Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
