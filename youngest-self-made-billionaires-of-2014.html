Roughly 1,645 of those people are billionaires. Not one of them yet? Don't worry there's still plenty time! Of the 1,645 billionaires, just a bit over 1,000 are self-made. That means they didn't inherit their wealth, they earned their fortunes themselves. And of that club of self-made billionaires, only 13 of them are under 40 years old. Not surprisingly, most young billionaires come from the tech world. Two of the most recognizable names – Google's <a href=#>Sergey Brin</a> and <a href=#>Larry Page</a>, are not eligible, as both turn 40 in 2014.</p><p>A key to making this list is to have gone to Harvard at the same time as <a href=#>Mark Zuckerberg</a> and have gotten involved in the early stages of Facebook – four of the 13 young billionaires owe their fortunes to Facebook. Many others come from small startups that got lucky, struck a chord with the public, and made their founders billionaires. But make no mistake, these self-made billionaires got lucky, but they also worked incredibly hard to build their companies and continue to do so even after striking it rich. &nbsp;Listed from oldest to youngest, these are the youngest self-made billionaires of 2014:</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-194425 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GettyImages-160790159.jpg alt="Ryan Kavanaugh" width=900 height=623 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-194425 class=wp-caption-text>Ryan Kavanaugh / Alberto E.

In 2014, Brown received an undisclosed (presumably very large) settlement from his former frat brothers.
