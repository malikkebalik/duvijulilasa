Unfortunately, the show was hit with a lawsuit due to one unhappy couple. Here's what the couple said about the show being fake.</p><p>Published on September 9, 2021</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_71>The <a href=#>discovery+</a> series Homestead Rescue shows Americans exactly how they can successfully live off the grid, thanks to the expertise of Marty Raney and his two kids, Misty Raney and Matt Raney. The Homestead Rescue cast aims to help out those who are struggling to make homesteading work by teaching them <a href=#>new skills for survival</a>. But some believe the show is totally fake following a Homestead Rescue lawsuit. Here’s what happened.</p><h2 id=h-marty-raney-and-his-kids-help-americans-live-successfully-off-the-grid>Marty Raney and his kids help Americans live successfully off the grid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-2_49>The Homestead Rescue cast features Marty Raney, <a href=#>an Alaskan outdoorsman</a> who knows exactly how to survive in the wilderness. He explained to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KXD 13 News</a> that he started as a logger in the Alaskan wilderness in the 1970s. He also stayed on a homestead in the frigid state.</p><p id=par-3_49>“I think this is why Discovery tuned in on me is that I had this long history of living all over Alaska, a lot of it remote and unique,” Marty explained. ” … I think Discovery liked the fact that my family had an adventurous, ongoing Alaskan history happening.”</p><p id=par-4_73>As for the show, it began in 2016 and still runs in 2021. Marty went on to explain how those looking to start homesteading want a “simpler life” away from the fast-paced world most of us live in today. “These off-gridders, these homesteaders … I mean, it’s pretty much once you get to the wilderness, nothing’s really changed from the original homesteaders …,” he added. “It’s a drastic departure from normalcy to adventure.”</p><h2 id=h-how-real-is-homestead-rescue-lawsuit-alleges-1-couple-was-duped-by-the-show>How real is ‘Homestead Rescue’? Lawsuit alleges 1 couple was duped by the show</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_25>While Marty and his family certainly have plenty of fans and followers, many still wonder how real the show is. Is Homestead Rescue fake?</p><p id=par-6_87>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Distractify</a>, the show might have some fabricated aspects, according to a few of the couples who actually took part in the show. One couple from season 1, Kim and Josh Zabec, were already successful homesteaders who owned Revolutionary Roots Farm. The Raneys went to their farm to help them fix it after pigs seemed to ruin part of their property. But Kim and Josh claimed the show made them look like amateurs when, in fact, they knew exactly how to successfully live off the grid.</p><p id=par-7_53>The publication notes the couple created their Homestead Rescue lawsuit after they feel production completely misled them. According to Kim and Josh, production told them they’d have a spot on the show as well-established homesteaders. Instead, the show allegedly portrayed them as people who had no idea how to run their farm.</p><h2 id=h-is-homestead-rescue-on-discovery>Is ‘Homestead Rescue’ on discovery+?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-8_31>How can fans watch the Raney family — and is Homestead Rescue on discovery+? Yes, the show is currently <a href=#>available on the streaming service</a>. Discovery+ offers a seven-day free trial.</p><p id=par-9_48>Additionally, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> notes Amazon Prime Video also supports streaming discovery+. “The ad-free version of discovery+ is now available on Prime Video Channels for $6.99 per month and the ad-supported version ($4.99 per month) will be available ‘in the coming months,'” the publication explained as of April 2021.</p><p id=par-10_41>A new episode of Homestead Rescue airs Sept. 9, 2021, at 8 p.m. EST, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Guide</a>. The plot synopsis states the new episode centers on the Raneys heading to Tennessee and helping a couple currently “stranded” in an RV.</p><p id=par-11_7>Check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sLnErKuemZRiv6a%2Fwq6cZqSRrMC2tdNmmKWklZyytHnArKeem6SoerS0zrBkn5mbmnupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./memes-tweets-about-kendall-jenner-bad-bunny-s-lakers-game-body-language.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Memes &amp;amp; Tweets About Kendall Jenner &amp;amp; Bad Bunny's Lakers Game Body Language</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kat-von-d-is-covering-most-of-her-tattoos-with-solid-black-ink-here-are-13-designs-she-s-replaced.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kat Von D is covering most of her tattoos with solid black ink.
