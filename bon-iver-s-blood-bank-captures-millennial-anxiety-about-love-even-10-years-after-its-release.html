The sound is raw and viscerally intimate, but the lyricism is opaque, easily transferred to many moments, emotions, and eras. One of the most enduring examples is <a href=# class=T3D>Bon Iver's "Blood Bank</a>," the title track of the band's brief but defining 2009 EP. What is, at surface level, a wistful eulogy to a relationship since past, has 10 years later become an unlikely ode to millennials' fears of opening up to one another.</p><p>Written during frontman Justin Vernon's fabled retreat to a remote cabin for For Emma, Forever Ago but held because it didn't "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>fit the story</a>," "Blood Bank" shares <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>the same fragility and longing</a> present on his storied debut, but in a different context. It's not about lost love, but falling into it anew, from a charged first meeting to a tender roadside kiss.</p><p>Vernon told NPR it was <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>a fictional love story</a>, a rumination on the magic of an undefinable bond. "I think that that secret [in the chorus] is the answer to all those questions," he said. "Why is this sacred and why does this feel larger than myself and larger than what I can even put into words ... I think it's the connection that we have to each other."</p><p></p><p>But while "Blood Bank" is, lyrically, one of Vernon's least ambiguous efforts, his work has long been more concerned with the way words sound than what they symbolize; as Stephen Deusner wrote for Stereogum, it's as though Vernon is "trying to find new ways to be a confessional songwriter. [He's] calibrating language to give just enough away and to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>stop short of overindulging or oversharing</a>." It's apt, then, that "Blood Bank" can be interpreted with a similar sense of constraint. Perhaps the couple's "secret" is not the feelings they can't put into words, but <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>those that they are too afraid to</a>.</p><p>It's a theme that speaks profoundly to the millennial dating climate, in which emotions are shared openly and unashamedly online, and yet <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>stifled in private</a>. It's why this generation has been labeled one <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>that "can't communicate"</a>: amid a culture demarcated by <a href=# class=T3D>Facetune and ghosting</a> and indefinite <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>situationships, being vulnerable</a> has become paralyzing.</p><p>The more you listen to "Blood Bank," the more attuned the song seems to 2019. Meeting someone at a blood bank is exactly the kind of quirky meet-cute you could envision in, say, a Girls episode; its somber, stripped-back tonality resembles the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>sad hip-hop suddenly inundating the Top 40</a>; and the line "ain't this just like the present, to be showing up like this" may as well be a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Jaden Smith tweet</a>. Vernon's confounding poeticism feels like the musical embodiment of mixed signals: "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>It f*cks with your honor, it teases your head</a>."</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Mark Metcalfe/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>There's also an inherent passivity — a chance meeting, a fleeting hookup — that evokes the nonchalance of modern dating. It's clear the couple Vernon sings of is in love, even envisioning a future ("What's that noise up the stairs babe? Is that Christmas morning creaks?"), but their inability to say so traps them in a perpetual limbo — one not unlike the nebulous something-or-others so popular in present day.</p><p>And it's palpable in the instrumentation, too. "Blood Bank" starts slow and plodding, but tense; you can feel the anticipation, there's a tightening in your chest. The electric guitar is a marked departure from Vernon's preferred acoustics, a subtle but jolting energy that mirrors the spark of a new crush. When he reaches the chorus, though, the song halts to a near-standstill, a weighted almost-silence much like those three unspoken words. And by the time the track arrives at its final verse, it's descended into a beautiful cacophony — either a chaotic end to a combustive romance, or a cathartic unleashing of those elusive "I love yous."</p><p>In the 10 years since its release, "Blood Bank" has been interpreted several times over: as a sorrowful remembrance <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>of an unplanned pregnancy</a>, a bittersweet <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>reflection on a soured affair. </a>But it's this that feels most resonant — representative of a time that shaped many of its early listeners, yet still evocative of their present. "Blood Bank" is a song that not only enraptured a generation, but has grown with them, too.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jpump2WZq7Kzv4ybo6inlGKvorrKZpqaqKSqv6a%2FjKagpaSVo7uqrctmmKewmZrBunnAm6aurF2hvLexjJ6tnqZdZn1uxcSaqaxlkZvBpr6MoqusZaKauaat0p5kam1oaIBxfI8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./do-lara-jean-and-peter-stay-together-after-college-lana-condor-has-the-perfect-theory.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Do Lara Jean and Peter Stay Together After College?
