Demi Lovato is best known as a successful solo recording artist who got her big break on the Disney Channel.</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Demetria Devonne Lovato was born on August 20, 1992, in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Her parents divorced in 1994 shortly after her second birthday, and she was raised in Dallas, Texas. She showed an interest in music and acting at an early age, and began playing the piano at age seven and guitar at age ten. She debuted on the children's television series Barney & Friends as the character Angela in 2002.</p><h2 id=acting-success><strong>Acting Success</strong></h2><p>Lovato first appeared on the Disney Channel in the short series As the Bell Rings from 2007 to 2008. She subsequently auditioned for two Disney Channel projects, the film Camp Rock and the series Sonny with a Chance in 2007, and landed both roles. Camp Rock premiered on the Disney Channel on June 20, 2008, to $8.9 million viewers. Her Disney Channel sitcom Sonny With a Chance premiered on February 8, 2009, and ran for two seasons until January 2, 2011.

In the summer of 2008, she signed with Hollywood Records. Her debut studio album Don't Forget was released in September 2008 to generally positive critical reviews. Her second album Here We Go Again (2009) was her first number one album, debuting at the top of the Billboard 200. Other subsequent albums by Lovato include Unbroken (2011), Demi (2013), Confident (2015), and Tell Me You Love Me (2017). Along with singer <a href=# title="Nick Jonas Net Worth">Nick Jonas</a> and their shared manager, Phil McIntyre, Lovato is co-founder of the record label Safehouse Records.

This was also her first musical appearance since her hiatus. As of March 2020, Lovato has embarked on five headlining concert tours.

In addition, she has performed at numerous festivals and other live events; for example, on February 2, 2020, she performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" at Super Bowl LIV.

Furthermore, she has won several awards, including five People's Choice Awards, an award at the MTV Video Music Awards, and a Billboard Women in Music Award. She has also received two Grammy Award nominations, four Billboard Music Awards nominations, and three Brit Award nominations.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-296104 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Demi-Lovato.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1784px) 100vw, 1784px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-296104 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=television-projects><strong>Television Projects</strong></h2><p>In 2012 Lovato became a judge and mentor for the second season of the American version of the musical competition show The X Factor alongside fellow judges <a href=# title="Britney Spears Net Worth">Britney Spears</a>, <a href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, and <a href=# title="L.A. Reid Net Worth">L.A. Reid</a>. She returned for the second season in 2013. Her salary while on the show is reported to have been as high as $2 million a year. When she began filming the second season of The X Factor USA, she was 19 years 9 months and 5 days old, making her the Guinness World Record holder for youngest judge in the X Factor global franchise.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Lovato has had her share of personal problems. She was treated at the Timberline Knolls Facility in Illinois, for bulimia and self-abuse issues. While under treatment, it was discovered that she also suffers from bipolar disorder. After punching Alex Welch (a backup singer for the Jonas Brothers), Lovato thought it best to seek professional help. She was sober for several years until July 2018 when she reportedly overdosed on drugs and re-entered a treatment facility. Immediately after the overdose she spent 10 days at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and then went straight to rehab.</p><p>She has dated a number of high-profile stars, including fellow Disney Channel star <a href=# title="Joe Jonas Net Worth">Joe Jonas</a> from 2008 to 2010. From 2010 to 2016, she was in a long-term relationship with actor <a href=# title="Wilmer Valderrama Net Worth">Wilmer Valderrama</a> and later dated professional MMA fighter <a href=# title="Luke Rockhold Net Worth">Luke Rockhold</a> for a few months in 2016. Others she has dated include MMA fighter Guilherme "Bomba" Vasconcelos, fashion designer Henri Alexander Levy, and model Austin Wilson.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>When Lovato was 16, she bought her family a $1.88 million house in the Toluca Lake area of Los Angeles. The 5,086 square foot Mediterranean-style home featured six bedrooms, seven bathrooms, wood floors, spacious walk ways and stairways, a private 3rd floor Suite, and a pool with a water-slide. Two years later, in 2010, Lovato dropped $2.25 million on a new family compound in Sherman Oaks, California.</p><p>In September 2016, Lovato spent $8.3 million on a home in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles. She listed the home for sale in September 2018 for $9.5 million. This home was basically a nightmare for Lovato. A few months after moving in, strong rainstorms threatened to cause the home to slide down the mountain. A mudslide surged down the hills above into her driveway causing the fire department to temporarily deem the house unlivable. It was in this home in 2018 where she was found after her non-fatal overdose from Oxycodone that had been laced with deadly fentanyl. After trying to sell the home for a number of years, Demi finally offloaded it in June 2020 for $8.25 million.</p><p>In September 2020 Demi paid $7 million for a newly-built mansion in Studio City, California.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHylscyiZKWnppbBsHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fireworks-celebration-manassas-park-community-center.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fireworks Celebration @ Manassas Park Community Center</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daveed-diggs-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Daveed Diggs Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
