ESPN broadcasts have cut into other sports to show his at-bats as he chases the American League record for home runs in a single season. Some pundits even suggest this is the&nbsp;true&nbsp;home run record since everything over 61 single-season home runs occurred during the steroids era.</p><p>Either way, Judge is having himself a fantastic season. Beyond the home runs, he's also flirting with a Triple Crown, which only a dozen players have pulled off since 1920. And <a href=# rel=noopener>as MLB.com points out</a>, Judge could even accomplish a Quadruple Triple Crown, leading at least the AL in a whopping 12 different categories.</p><p>What makes Judge's historic season even more noteworthy is that it's happening during a contract year… and that means he's about to get <strong>PAID</strong> this offseason.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-337995 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429432808.jpg alt width=900 height=599 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-337995 class=wp-caption-text>Sarah Stier/Getty Images</p><p>Before the 2022 season started, Aaron and the New York Yankees weren't able to negotiate a contract extension. Yankees general manager <a href=#>Brian Cashman</a> told reporters the team offered Judge $17 million in arbitration and a seven-year, $213.5 million contract. Judge turned the deal down, likely looking at some of the other deals star players were getting and believing he was worth more. But he did make a counter offer! Rumors suggest that Aaron indicated to the Yankees that he would sign a 10-year, $360 million deal. But the Yanks apparently declined.</p><p>Instead, Judge received $19 million this season through arbitration.</p><p>And now, after betting on himself, he's likely looking at an enormous payday. Judge would have made a little more than $30 million per year with his last deal. Thanks to his impressive season, he should receive an offer worth more in both annual and total value.</p><p><strong>How much bigger?</strong></p><p>As a comp, <a href=# title="Juan Soto Net Worth">Juan Soto</a> is currently reportedly looking to lock down a 10-year, $450 million deal. That's an average annual contract value of $45 million. But Juan Soto is 23 years old. Judge is 30, and it's unlikely a team will take a 10-year risk at $40+ million locked-in.</p><p>Furthermore, as <a href=# rel=noopener>ESPN's Jeff Passan notes</a>, larger sluggers tend to have deals that age poorly. Any team that signs Judge will be looking to maximize the first five years of his deal. A team could also get creative with its contract and front-load the money so Judge is making more when he's younger and presumably more productive. Yet even in that case, he'd end up with a higher salary.</p><p>As a reminder, Aaron already turned down a 7-year $213 million offer BEFORE this monster season. So with all these facts, let's assume Aaron will be looking for something in the range of 7-years and $350 million. That would equate to $50 million per year as an average annual value.</p><p>If that's what happens, Aaron will have made $370 million over the course of time (including this season's $19 million) as opposed to $230 million. In other words, if these hypothetical numbers prove accurate, by betting on himself Aaron will have earned himself an extra…</p><h2><strong>$140 million</strong></h2><p>For now, Judge is focused on helping the Yankees win a World Series. But after the postseason, it's time to focus on his financials.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqYq6eeYre2sMaeZKudmpqwtbHDZphmpZGowKrCxGaaqKakp66kwIylmKysXa6yor6MraZmmpWperC6jKGgpquVobNuwMeiqmaxlZa%2FbrTEZpqhp6Oaeri10p6jsmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./map-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Map | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zooey-deschanel-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zooey Deschanel Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
