A new Tell-All book about Kate implies that after meeting Prince William through friends at her boarding school she hatched a plan to get closer to him. Instead of attending Edinburgh where she was originally accepted, she took a year off to stay on track with William and applied to University of St. Andrews in order to be at the same school as her mark. As she grew closer to the prince many of the girls in her circle began to shun Kate, probably out of jealousy more than anything.</p><p>According to the Sept. 23rd print edition of Life & Style magazine after William dragged out the couple’s relationship for years <strong>Carole Middleton</strong> decided to confront him. Back in 2009 he sat William down and demanded to know what his intentions truly were towards her daughter. At the time William reassured Carole that he wasn’t stringing Kate along and that he fully intended to marry her. Obviously that was a promise that Wills kept proving that all of those years of being referred to as Waity Katy by the British press would eventually pay off for Kate.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async title="Carole Middleton Forced Prince William to Marry Kate After His Affair With Isabella Calthorpe" alt="Carole Middleton Forced Prince William to Marry Kate After His Affair With Isabella Calthorpe" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/prince_harry_cressida_bonas7.jpg width=480 height=360 sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Carole and Kate must have been in a panic as in 2007 William dumped Kate in order to pursue <strong>Isabella Calthorpe</strong>.&nbsp; Kate is a nice looking woman but Isabella is a rare beauty – and unlike commoner Kate she was born an aristocrat.&nbsp; Isabella toyed with Will for a while and then told him she wasn’t interested in being his bride. After being refused by the woman he really wanted, Will took Kate back.&nbsp; Oh by the way, Isabella married Richard Branson’s son Sam and is the half-sister of <a rel=nofollow href=#><strong>Prince Harry’s</strong> rumored fiance</a> to be,&nbsp;<strong>Cressida Bonas</strong>.&nbsp; No wonder <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kate hates Cressida and is trying to break up the couple!</a></p><p>Do you think that Kate really had set her sights on William years ago and stayed the course until they were finally married? Both have spoken of being glad that they waited so long to marry because by the time the vows were swapped they truly knew everything about each other. They also seem to believe that waiting helped them to be sure that this relationship is the real deal for both of them. Do you think that it helped to ultimately solidify them?
