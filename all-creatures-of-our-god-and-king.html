In his youth, Francis loved pleasure and lived frivolously, but God was soon to capture his attention. At about 20 years of age, Francis took part in a small local battle. He was taken prisoner and was held for over a year. During this time of captivity, Francis determined to live a more noble and meaningful life, and once he was free, he set out to pursue a military career.</p><p>One night before heading off for war, Francis had a dream in which he saw a long hall hung with armor bearing the sign of the cross. He heard a voice say, “These are for you and your soldiers.” Francis awoke feeling certain that he would achieve great success in battle. However, a serious illness detained his journey, and another dream persuaded him to return to Assisi in Italy.</p><p>After much prayer, Francis finally recognized that God had been directing him to a spiritual life, and he humbly submitted. On noticing his changed demeanor and distracted mind, his companions teased him and asked if he had plans to be married. Francis replied, “Yes. I am about to take a wife of surpassing fairness.” Sure enough, it was “Lady Poverty” to which he would devote his life. Francis had been meditating on Scripture and was struck by Christ’s commandment to leave all things and follow him. This became the rule of his life.</p><p>Though people scoffed at Francis initially, with time he would earn the love and respect of his generation, as well as many generations to follow. The popularity of Francis may largely be attributed to his winsome personality, as well as the kindness and compassion shown by his followers. He founded the order of Franciscans and sent them to preach the gospel and help the needy. In contrast to the medieval mindset of the time, Francis and his friars showed particular concern for the sick, the poor, and the outcasts of society. Francis delighted not just in humanity, but in animals, nature, and song. In fact, it is believed that St. Francis and his friars were the first to compose Christmas carols.</p><p>“All Creatures of Our God and King” was written in the summer of 1125 (the year before Francis’ death) when he was very ill and suffering the loss of his sight.1 It was originally titled “Cantico di fratre sole” (Song of Brother Sun). It is believed to be “the oldest religious poem extant in the Italian language.”2 It was translated (or rather paraphrased) from Italian to English by <a onclick='pageTracker._trackPageview("/outgoing/www.hymntime.com/tch/bio/d/r/a/draper_wh.htm")' href=#>William Draper</a> for a children’s celebration of Pentecost in England. The hymn was first published in the Public School Hymn Book in 1919.3</p><p><strong>Tune “Lasst Uns Erfreuen” adapted and harmonized in 1906 by Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958), Published in 1623<br></strong></p><img title="Ralph Vaughan Williams" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebratingholidays.com/Pictures/hymns/williams.jpg alt="Ralph Vaughan Williams" width=200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br><span><strong>Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958)</strong></span><p>The tune “Lasst Uns Erfreuen” first appeared in a Catholic hymnal published in Cologne in 1623 and was well known in southern Germany.
