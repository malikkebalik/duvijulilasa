Felipe VI of Spain has a net worth of $3 million. In his role, he dissolved the Spanish Parliament in 2016, condemned the Catalonian independence referendum, and made strides toward greater transparency in royal affairs. As a constitutional monarch, Felipe serves as commander-in-chief of the Spanish Armed Forces and represents Spain in international relations.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Felipe VI was born on January 30, 1968 in Madrid, Spain as the third child and only son of Spanish aristocrat Juan Carlos I and <a href=#>Princess Sofía of Greece</a> and Denmark. He is the third cousin once removed of such noble figures as <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, <a href=#>King Harald V</a>, and <a href=#>Margrethe II</a>. After Spanish dictator Francisco Franco died in 1975, Felipe's father took over as King of Spain. For his education, Felipe went to Santa María de los Rosales in Spain and then to Lakefield College School in Ontario, Canada. He subsequently attended the Autonomous University of Madrid, from which he graduated with a law degree. Felipe went on to round out his education by earning a Master of Science in Foreign Service from Georgetown University in Washington, DC.</p><h2 id=military-training><strong>Military Training</strong></h2><p>With his father on the throne, Felipe was officially proclaimed Prince of Asturias in 1977. On his 18th birthday in 1986, he swore allegiance to the Constitution and to the King to accept his role as successor to the monarchy. As heir, Felipe underwent a rigorous military training regimen, which began at the General Military Academy in Zaragoza. Next, he began naval training at the Escuela Naval Militar in Marin. Felipe went on to commence air force training at the Academia General del Aire in Murcia in 1987.</p><h2 id=princely-activities><strong>Princely Activities</strong></h2><p>In his role as heir to the throne, Felipe took on his duties required by the Constitution. Most significantly, he began representing Spain on his official visits to the Spanish Autonomous Communities, as well as on his visits to various Latin American nations. Felipe also started representing Spain at world economic and trade events, promoting the country's economic and cultural interests.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-172668 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/King-Felipe-VI.jpg alt="Felipe VI of Spain" width=594 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-172668 class=wp-caption-text>Juan Naharro Gimenez/Getty Images</p><h2 id=king-spain><strong>King of Spain</strong></h2><p>Upon the abdication of his father in 2014, Felipe ascended to the throne, becoming the new King of Spain. In his role as a constitutional monarch, he is responsible for ensuring that the Constitution is followed; his political powers may otherwise not be exercised unless they are countersigned by a minister.</p><p>During his reign, Felipe dissolved the Spanish Parliament after no party was able to win enough seats in the elections in 2015. Consequently, new elections were called for June in 2016. He oversaw a number of other historic events, including being the first Spanish king to receive LGBTQ organizations at the palace. Felipe also changed the government protocol so that people taking the oath of office no longer had to do so with a bible or crucifix.</p><p>Felipe has also courted his fair share of controversy. In 2017, he drew attention for strongly condemning the Catalan independence referendum, which called for Catalonia to become an independent republic. He got into more controversy in 2020 when it was revealed that he was the second beneficiary of the Lucus Foundation, an entity that received a €65 million donation from Saudi Arabian <a href=#>King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz</a>. To make his affairs more transparent, Felipe disclosed his personal assets to the public, which were revealed to be valued at around €2.6 million.</p><h2 id=other-positions><strong>Other Positions</strong></h2><p>Beyond his royal office, Felipe has been involved in various associations and foundations. Notably, he presides over the annual Princess of Asturias Awards, given by the Príncipe de Asturias Foundation. Felipe is also a member of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution, due to being a descendant of Spanish <a href=# title="King Charles Net Worth">King Charles</a> III.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>For a long time, Felipe remained a bachelor. In the late 80s and into the 90s, he was romantically linked to Spanish noblewoman Isabel Sartorius, who was viewed unfavorably by the Spanish royal family due to her mother's cocaine habit, and to Norwegian underwear model Eva Sannum. Finally, in late 2003, Felipe got engaged to television journalist <a href=#>Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano</a>, whom he married in the spring of 2004. She became the Queen of Spain when Felipe ascended to the throne a decade later. Felipe and Letizia have two daughters named Leonor and Sofía.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6sbvLoquim5mWu7R70aiwmqSjZLOmuMipnGaumWLAsa3Ip2SnnaRixLC%2B06Fm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mario-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mario Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fallout-shady-sands-explained.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Fallout: Shady Sands, explained</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
