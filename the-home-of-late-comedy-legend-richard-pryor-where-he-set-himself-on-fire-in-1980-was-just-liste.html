First off, it was where late comedy legend <a href=#>Richard Pryor</a> lived for several years after purchasing it during his heyday in 1976. On a grimmer note, it's where his infamous freebasing suicide attempt took place in 1980. In 1994, a significant portion of the property was destroyed by the Northridge Earthquake. And now, <a href=#>Rashard Mendenhall</a>, the NFL running back turned "Ballers" screenwriter, has listed it for sale with an asking price north of $4.3 million.</p><p>The home, officially known as Hacienda de los Suenos, is located in Northridge's Sherwood Forest community. And its official listing notes it's had a fascinating story even outside of the showbiz realm:</p><p><strong>"This remarkable property boasts a captivating history, transitioning from its roots as an early California citrus plantation to its current status as a sought-after celebrity compound with unrivaled amenities. This is a legal Horse property, although no horses have been on the property for over 30 years."</strong></p><p>Resting on 2.2 acres of lush landscaping, the property is actually more of a complex, sprawling across 9,000 square feet of interior living space between its six separate structures. In the main house, you'll find four beds and four baths, plus amenities like a billiard room and general game room. There's a guest house, a professional dance studio or gym that the listing says could be converted into a recording space, an office, a children's playhouse, and a garage with room for three cars. Of course, there's room for many more cars than that in the property's designated event parking area, making it a great spot for prolific entertainers (not just comedians). And it's just as impressive outdoors as it is in:</p><p><strong>"The outdoor oasis is a spectacle in itself, featuring a enormous resort-style pool with spa and cascading waterfall. A barbecue pavilion, tennis court, putting green, citrus grove, vegetable garden, and expanses of groomed lawns create an idyllic setting for relaxation and recreation. Indulge in additional luxuries such as a sauna, kitchen in the pool house, wine closet, and more, ensuring every aspect of refined living is catered to."</strong></p><p>Mendenhall reportedly purchased the property in 2017, paying $2.5 million at that time. That was just a couple years after he retired from the NFL and ended up being a writer and story consultant for the HBO series "Ballers," although his IMDb page doesn't show any other writing credits since then.</p><p>Take a look at the former Richard Pryor Estate in the video below, from Jason Peteler on YouTube:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGeknbJutM6mnGanlmK5osDEZpqopZWZxm64xKCcp5xdp7aktMCrm2aooq68s3nWoZyrnV2dsm6%2FxK1koaGdqLKtsoyopWaemaeybrXNZmhycGBixKK%2FjKOsrKxdoba0wMSdZJ%2BnomKBbn%2BVZqSipJyevK97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./this-week-s-no-1-rap-album-was-made-by-someone-you-may-not-have-expected.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Week's No. 1 Rap Album Was Made By Someone You May Not Have Expected</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-friends-cast-ranked-by-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Friends cast ranked by net worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
