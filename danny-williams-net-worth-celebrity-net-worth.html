Born August 4, 1949 in St. John's, Newfoundland, Danny Williams is also known as Danny Millions, a nickname given to him during the early 2000s in light of his financial success from the sale of the communications portion and the cable TV portion (respectively) of his company Cable Atlantic for a total of over $225 million. Besides being a high-priced lawyer and a savvy businessman, Williams served as the ninth Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador between 2003 and 2010. Born and raised in Newfoundland and Labrador, he originally emerged in politics as the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2001, after which he was elected to the House of Assembly for the district of Humber West in Corner Brook.</p><p>His premiership was considered controversial by outsiders due to such events as ordering all Canadian flags to be removed from provincial government buildings and launching the Anything But Conservative campaign in the 2008 federal election, which garnered national attention. Though Williams continues to be a controversial politician outside of Newfoundland and Labrador, he remains ranked as one of the most popular premiers of Canada. His education was in political science and economics (Memorial University of Newfoundland), Arts in Law (Keble College, Oxford-where he also played college hockey) and a law degree in Bachelor of Laws (Dalhousie University). The week Williams departed from politics, in 2010, a poll was conducted that showed that 90 percent of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians were either or mostly satisfied with the performance of the government, 75 percent supported the Progressive Conservatives and 76 percent thought Williams was the best choice for premier.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6sbvLoquim5mWu7R7w5qlp7FdrLatuMiapKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-first-person-shooter-ft-j-cole-mp3-download.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Drake First Person Shooter Ft.
