So when it came time to decide who did what, it was easy. Everyone did everything&nbsp;–&nbsp;block, tackle, catch passes, run the ball, and even pass. True, some did more than others, but everyone got the chance.&nbsp;As we got older and bigger, the game took on a whole different meaning. Fun was still important, but the game became a means to an end. Play well enough and college could be in the future. Continue to play well and there was the NFL and financial security for life to think about. That meant specializing and focusing on one task&nbsp;–&nbsp;one position&nbsp;–&nbsp;on the field.</p><p>Last year the NFL generated over <strong>$11 billion</strong> in revenue. With the windfall that is coming in the salary cap for the coming season is going to increase to $143 million. Some players are going to make an obscene amount of money, others are going to make a lot of money and some are just going to make good money (rookie minimum of $435K certainly qualifies as good).</p><p>It is all pretty much predicated off of the preserved value of the player to the team. So&nbsp;–&nbsp;what position does it pay to play the most?</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-156376 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Peyton-Manning.jpg alt="Ezra Shaw/Getty Images" width=900 height=622 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-156376 class=wp-caption-text>Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</p><p>Offenses win games and the success of the offense is determined typically by how well a quarterback plays. That could explain why six of the ten highest paid players (salary, endorsements, and bonuses) are quarterbacks:</p><ul><li><a href=# title="Ben Roethlisberger Net Worth">Ben Roethlisberger</a> $48.9 Million ($46.4 salary, $2.5 endorsements)</li><li><a href=# title="Carson Palmer Net Worth">Carson Palmer</a> $29 million ($28.5 million salary, $500K endorsements)</li><li><a href=#>Peyton Manning</a> ($27 Million; $15 million salary, $12 million endorsements)</li><li><a href=#>Eli Manning</a> $23.7 million ($15.7 million salary, $8 million endorsements)</li><li><a href=# title="Andy Dalton Net Worth">Andy Dalton</a> $23.3 million ($22.3 million salary, $1 million endorsements)</li><li><a href=# title="Tony Romo Net Worth">Tony Romo</a> $22 million ($17 million salary, $5 million endorsements)</li></ul><p>Actually, nine of the top 15 highest paid players in the NFL are quarterbacks. Along with the six in the top ten there is:</p><ul><li><a href=# title="Drew Brees Net Worth">Drew Brees</a> $22 million ($11 million salary, $11 million endorsements)</li><li><a href=# title="Alex Smith Net Worth">Alex Smith</a> $19.6 million ($19.1 salary, $500K endorsements)</li><li><a href=# title="Aaron Rodgers Net Worth">Aaron Rodgers</a> $19.1 million ($11.6 million salary, $7.5 million endorsements)</li></ul><p>While offense wins games, defense wins championships. A quarterback is only as good as what he has the time to do or can create. A good defensive lineman can severely limit what a quarterback is able to do making him a very valuable player. That could very well be why three of the top six highest paid players in the game are on the defensive front:</p><ul><li><a href=#>Ndamukong Suh</a> $38.6 million ($38.2 million salary, $400K endorsements)</li><li>J. Watt $27.9 million ($20.9 million salary, $7 million endorsements)</li><li><a href=# title="Gerald McCoy Net Worth">Gerald McCoy</a> $26.7 million ($26.5 million salary, $150K endorsements)</li></ul><p>This is not to say that it doesn't pay well to play any other position on the field. Protecting the quarterback can pay well. Two offensive lineman made the list of the top 16 highest paid players in the NFL—Tyron Smith $21.4 million ($21.1 million salary, $250K endorsements) and Maurkice Pouncey $18.9 million ($18.8 million salary, $100K endorsements).</p><p>It just so happens to pay better to throw the ball or tackle the guy that throws the ball.</p><p>The 16 highest paid players in the NFL are as follows:</p><li>Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger $48.9 M</li><li>Miami Dolphins DL Ndamukong Suh $38.6 M</li><li>Arizona Cardinals QB Carson Palmer $29 M</li><li>Houston Texans DL J.J.
