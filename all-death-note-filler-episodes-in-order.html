The show which first premiered in 2006 has become a classic that generations of anime fans have grown to love.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Like any anime, newcomers to the series want the most authentic and true experience of the story and a big part of that is weeding out any filler episodes. Longrunning anime series are often plagued with filler to buff their runtime and provide content while creators work on new manga stories to be adapted.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=414 data-injectable=true>Death Note like most anime doesn’t adapt from its manga source material perfectly, however, it is close.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>All Death Note filler episodes</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/Death-Note-.jpg><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false>Fortunately, skipping out on filler episodes for Death Note is very easy as there are none.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>There are only a few episodes in the entire run that can be classified as containing filler, however, they are all split between manga canon and filler so you’ll want to watch them anyways. Here is a look at the episodes which fall in this category.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>What sections of Death Note are filler?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sj6851hv-720.jpeg><h3 data-injectable=false>Episode 1: “Rebirth”</h3><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=451 data-injectable=true>Technically the first episode of Death Note contains filler, however, much of the episode is still considered canon and important to the show’s plot.</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>During the episode, Light initially leaves the Death Note before returning to pick it up due to curiosity. This does not happen in the manga, instead, he picks it up straight away. Also, there is no montage of Light learning how to kill criminals in the manga.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>It is worth noting also that the introduction to Ryuk is more detailed in the Manga than what we were provided within the series, though it is still canon.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Episode 25: “Silence”</h3><p data-characters=163 data-current-count=163 data-injectable=false>In the Death Note season one finale fans get the ultimate payoff of the events leading up to this point as the game of chess between Kira and L reached its climax.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>While this episode is integral to the show’s story, there is one big change from the manga source material that has landed Silence on the partial canon episode list.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>When finally being beaten and collapsing to his death L stares at Light without saying a word before dying. In the manga, this scene sees L let out one last whisper before his death acknowledging that Light had been Kira.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Episode 26: “Renewal”</h3><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=164 data-injectable=false>Episode 26 includes many scenes that retell the events from the first 25 episodes of the series and as one would expect, these were not a part of the manga chapter.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>The episode gets to its canonical portion once we jump forward in time to meet L’s successors Near and Mello.</p><h3 data-injectable=false>Episode 37: “New World”</h3><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>Death Note’s final episode strays the furthest from the manga be it only with slight changes, but as such is it considered a mixed filler and canon episode. The biggest changes are made to the fates of Light and Misa.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Light in the anime is shot and killed, however, in the manga, he begs Ryuk to help him kill Near and Matsuda but is ultimately betrayed as the Shinigami writes his name inside the notebook. Ryuk tells Light that he decided to take things into his own hands so that Light would not rot in prison.</p><p data-characters=168 data-current-count=463 data-injectable=false>The other big change is in Misa’s fate. In the show, she is alive and well at the end of the series while in the manga source material she dies by committing suicide.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6ao6VllJqutbSMp6atnV2btq24xKtknqiZqLylsdJmoKdln6expr6O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashleigh-lathrop-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ashleigh LaThrop Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./raising-spirits-star-theresa-caputo-is-rumored-to-be-in-love-again.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Raising Spirits' Star Theresa Caputo Is Rumored to Be in Love Again</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
