When she first appeared on the show with her<a href=#> boyfriend Zied Hakimi</a>, she had been heavily editing her photos so Hakimi didn’t even know what she looked like in real life. But since meeting Hakimi, Parrott has changed up her style a bit to appear more youthful. Recently, Parrot got a full makeover that has fans raving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rebecca-and-Zied.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-90-day-fianc-star-rebecca-parrott-s-weight-loss-journey>’90 Day Fiancé’ star Rebecca Parrott’s weight loss journey</h2><p id=par-2_39>Parrott has been self-conscious about her weight since she was younger. Recently, she decided to do something about her insecurity and have a procedure done but she didn’t want to do anything invasive. Instead, she decided to try TriSculpt.</p><p id=par-3_42>“Here’s the BEFORE/AFTER of my first procedure with&nbsp;<a href=#>@sonobello</a>&nbsp;❤️ It was life-changing to have the extra skin removed on my lower stomach,” she captioned a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">photo</a> of her transformation. “My next procedure, coming soon, will target my legs and thighs. I can’t wait!”</p><p id=par-4_20>In the comments’ section of the photo, Parrott revealed that the procedure typically costs between $1400 and $2800 per area.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rebecca-parrott-before-and-after>Rebecca Parrott before and after</h2><p id=par-5_26>Parrott’s red locks have been a staple of her appearance since she first appeared on the show. But recently, she replaced them with long brunette extensions.</p><p id=par-6_35>“Omg I am obsessed with my hair!&nbsp;<a href=#>@thetiffanysmith</a>&nbsp;colored it and put in my extensions!! I’ll post more info soon, my phone is dying,” she captioned a photo debuting her new hair. See her new look <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_18>90 Day Fiancé stars Kenneth Niedermeier and Armando Rubio both commented on the post, applauding her new look.</p><p id=par-8_27>“Omg you look 20 wtf I was scrolling and was like woah woah who’s this hottie,” 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Tiffany Franco Smith commented.</p><p id=par-9_12>“Whaaaaat?!? You look like you’re in your early 30s,” one fan wrote.</p><p id=par-10_18>“Woah amazing! Don’t go back to red. This looks so good. So much young looking,” another person commented.</p><p id=par-11_18>“Holy hair! I almost didn’t even realize it was you! You look awesome as always!!!” another user commented.</p><p id=par-12_16>“Rebecca!! I love your signature red hair….but this look is amazing on you!” another fan wrote.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rebecca-and-zied-s-relationship>Rebecca and Zied’s relationship</h2><p id=par-13_46>In the past, Parrott’s appearance has been a <a href=#>problem in her relationship</a> with Hakimi. On season 3 of Before the 90 Days, Hakimi was uncomfortable with the risqué way that Parrott dressed. Fans called Hakimi out for trying to control Parrott’s clothing but Parrot defended him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_58>“To clarify a little…. please understand that I know I was wrong for what I did. Zied never told me what to wear in all the time we were together before this,” she&nbsp;said in a video.&nbsp;“And my ex was very controlling. So I reacted very badly. I respect him and his culture and I made a bad decision.”</p><p id=par-15_44>Things have seemingly gotten better for the two. Hakimi’s K-1 visa was approved and he was able to move to America to live with Parrott full-time. The two have since gotten married and their wedding was shown on 90 Day Fiancé Season 8.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjKucm52TmK5uvMCrqaispGK2tHnApaSoq6Riwq%2B%2BxJymoKaZr66juMRmq6hllpa7tHnAn6ueql2XvK6u0qGcpaRdoq6ssc6vnKtmmKm6rXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-stanley-baxter-the-scottish-comedian-is-a-screen-stage-radio-legend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Stanley Baxter?
