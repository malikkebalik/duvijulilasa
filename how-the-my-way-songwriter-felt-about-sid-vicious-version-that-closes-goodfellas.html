Within a few years, everyone from Nina Simone to Shirley Bassey to Sinatra pal Sammy Davis Jr. had taken their turn at the track.</p><p id=par-2_45>By the end of the ’70s, with the punk era in full swing, Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols took his own whack at “My Way.” Vicious performed his version in a classic scene from Julien Temple’s The Great Rock ‘n’ Roll Swindle (1980).</p><p id=par-3_30>Vicious starts out hilariously off-key, giving it the approximate amount of respect you’d expect from him. But after the mock-ballad opening, the track turns punk and Vicious embraces the material.</p><p id=par-4_51>Looking back on Vicious’ take on the track, Anka recalled questioning whether to grant the license in the first place. But he didn’t regret it. In his 2013 autobiography, Anka said he was “pleased” that Vicious was touched by “My Way.” Later, he greenlighted the use of the rendition in Goodfellas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paul-anka-said-he-was-flattered-and-amused-by-sid-vicious-doing-my-way>Paul Anka said he was ‘flattered’ and ‘amused’ by Sid Vicious doing ‘My Way’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Sid-vicious.jpg><p id=par-5_40>You can probably guess the title of Anka’s autobiography (it’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">My Way</a>), and it’s an entertaining read. Many of Anka’s most fascinating stories revolve around his best-known song. (For example, Anka didn’t like the idea of Elvis Presley singing it.)</p><p id=par-6_45>On the subject of Vicious and “My Way,” Anka reacted the way most people would — he thought the Sex Pistols bassist would mock it. But Anka called around and “realized [Vicious’] intent was sincere.” So he granted the license. “He’s entitled,” Anka recalled thinking.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_45>Once he heard Vicious’ version, Anka liked how the song won over the punk rocker. “He starts out making fun of it, but then he gets swept up in it,” Anka wrote. “It’s as if the song reaches out and grabs him by the foot.”</p><p id=par-8_39>In the end, Anka considered it a great call. “I was very amused by it,” Anka wrote. “I was flattered that a punk like Sid wanted to do ‘My Way,’ someone who was into music totally different from mine.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-anka-didn-t-think-twice-about-having-vicious-my-way-in-goodfellas>Anka didn’t think twice about having Vicious’ ‘My Way’ in ‘Goodfellas’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sinatra-elvis.jpg><p id=par-9_36>Anka didn’t write “My Way” for Sinatra by accident. The Canadian-born songwriter revered Sinatra, and when he told Anka he was contemplating retirement, Anka sprung into action. He wrote the lyrics with Sinatra’s voice in mind.</p><p id=par-10_44>Decades later, Anka still thought no one had touched the original Sinatra recording. “‘My Way’ was Sinatra’s way — and that was the right way, basically the only way,” Anka wrote in his book. That said, the songwriter admired how Vicious handled the tune.</p><p id=par-11_51>“What [Vicious] did worked as both a goof and a sincere take,” Anka wrote. (He considered that “a pretty amazing accomplishment.”) After seeing it in The Great Rock ‘n’ Roll Swindle, Anka heard from Martin Scorsese in the late ’80s. He wanted to use the Vicious version in his own film.</p><p id=par-12_32>“When Scorsese called to use ‘My Way’ at the end of <a href=#>Goodfellas</a>, I was all for it,” Anka recalled in his autobiography. “It had an anger to it, a voicing of resentments.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6unnWmrBmq5%2BjtLi%2ByK2cq2WWmrm1edKim2aumZi2sMHSZq2eqqOevK95wqWmrJ2jYrSwu8OfnKWkkah7qcDMpWY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./if-you-want-to-get-rich-as-an-nfl-player-you-need-to-play-one-of-these-positions.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>If You Want To Get Rich As An NFL Player, You Need To Play One Of These Positions...</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-is-rod-stewart-doing-after-his-cancer-diagnosis-plus-what-s-his-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How is Rod Stewart Doing After His Cancer Diagnosis, Plus What's His Net Worth?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
