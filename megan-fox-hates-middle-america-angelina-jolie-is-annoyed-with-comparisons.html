First, let me just ask – is there something wrong with this girl? It’s becoming ridiculous with these daily Megan Fox quotes, and I’m starting to worry that we’re making fun of a girl who just isn’t right in the head. But for now, I’ll just assume that she’s simply dumb.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href=#>Megan’s dumb quote of the day</a> was “I turned into a really butch bull dyke for, like, six months … Then I went in the other direction. From being a giant motorcycle-riding lesbian, I turned into a zombie.” Now people are talking about an interview Megan did with <a href=#>Total Film UK</a>– but I could only find the text of the interview on the fansite <a href=#>Megan’s a Fox</a>. Yikes, right? That site is the pits. They have all of these pictures up of Megan throughout the last few years, and I swear I counted five different noses. But I digress. Megan was asked… well, I’ll let Total Film put in context:</p><p>[While] indoors, time spent talking nonsense leads to questions like this: If you could take Megatron to one side, have a coffee with him and talk him down from wrecking the entire world, what would you say?</p><p>“God!” laughs Fox. “That’s a question I don’t have an answer for and I hate you for asking me that because I’m usually so prepared!”</p><p>She considers. “I think I would make a deal with him and say instead of the entire planet, can you just take out all of the white trash, hillbilly, anti-gay, super bible-beating people in Middle America?”</p><p>[From Total Film UK via <a href=#>Megan’s A Fox </a>Fansite]</p><p>Let me just take one of those descriptions out of the air. Let’s take “anti-gay”. Does Megan Fox really have any right to mock anyone, much less the entire middle of the country as “anti-gay” after yesterday’s “butch bull dyke” comment? And as far as “hillbilly”… well, Megan, sometimes being trashy is a state of mind. Look in the mirror for further explanation.</p><p>In other Megan Fox-related news, Life & Style (the most budget of the tabloids, in my opinion) has an interesting cover story this week: “It’s War! Megan Fox vs. Angelina”. Unfortunately, the story seems entirely based on one producer’s idea to do a Lara Croft origin film, with Megan Fox cast as the “young Lara”. Apparently, this producer commented to someone that Angelina would not be cast as the young Lara Croft because Angie is “too old”. Angelina is 34 years old. Gasp! Hand me the Botox, grandpappy:</p><p>Angelina Jolie celebrated her 34th birthday on June 4. But while she should have been relaxing with beau Brad Pitt and their six kids, she was instead being forced to watch her back.</p><p>Just days earlier, Hollywood producer Dan Lin announced that he was planning a new installment of Angie’s Tomb Raider series, which turned the actress into a star and has grossed a whopping $431 million worldwide. But he doesn’t seem to be considering Angie for the lead this time around — because, he confessed, she’s simply too old.</p><p>“It’s a great origin story that we’re going to tell,” said Lin, who recently produced Terminator Salvation. “So it’s a younger Lara Croft.” Anyone in particular in mind for the lead role? Transformers star Megan Fox, he noted, was a “no-brainer.”</p><p>No wonder: Megan, a dark-haired beauty with full lips and an edgy reputation, has often been compared to Angelina. But Angie isn’t flattered by the comparison — or the suggestion that Megan, 23, may be ready to replace her.</p><p>“Angie is not thrilled about turning 34, to put it mildly,” says a friend. “In fact, she’s panicking a little. She feels that her age is starting to undercut her choice of film roles — and it annoys her that Megan Fox is being touted as the ‘new Angelina.'”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Life and Style</a>]</p><p>I would think Angelina would be annoyed with comparisons to Megan Fox because Megan is such a galloping moron. Other than that… well, of course the producers want someone younger for the Lara Croft origin story. Dur. Angelina was 25 years old when she was playing Lara for the first film (filming in 2000). They can’t have Angelina as a 34 year old trying to play the character in her late teens-early twenties. And Megan Fox has spent a lot of money to look like a younger, harder, cheaper version of Angelina, so I can see why the producers are looking at Megan. It’s going to be rough hearing Megan attempt that accent, though!</p><p>Megan Fox is shown out on 3/26/09. Angelina Jolie is shown on 3/21/09.
