He appeared today on the <a href=#>program </a><a href=#>Loose Women</a>to discuss his ordeal.</p><p id=par-4_29>“We were absolutely shattered, but I had this marvelous specimen of a woman by my side to get me through it,” he said referring to his wife, Penny.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_21>Stewart didn’t stop touring or making music during his treatment; in fact, the singer feels working helped him get through it.</p><p id=par-6_25>“I worked for two years knowing it was there. You can’t dwell on it. Be confident and let God take care of the rest.”</p><p id=par-7_13>He also urged men to stop putting off getting their prostates checked.</p><p id=par-8_22>“My dad never went to the dentist and he died with no teeth. Please, guys, finger up the bum no harm done.”</p><h2>How many times has Rod Stewart been married?</h2><p id=par-9_10>The English superstar has walked down the aisle three times.</p><p id=par-10_49>His <a href=#>first wife was Alana Hamilton</a>, who the artist was married to from 1979 to 1984. Hamilton said of their marriage, “Between his touring and the recording, playing soccer and the late nights out with the boys, I started to feel that everything came before me and the children.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-106860424.jpg><p id=par-11_34>In 1990, Rod married Rachel Hunter. She left Stewart in 2006 due to, as Hunter tells it, her feeling smothered in the marriage. She was only 21 when she married the 45-year-old Stewart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-76163214.jpg><p id=par-12_49>“I’d become so cosseted I was too scared to do anything for myself,” <a href=#>The Daily Mail reported</a> Hunter as saying. “Like lots of women who marry young and find themselves mothers by the time they’re 25, I felt I no longer had an identity. I was just nothing.”</p><p id=par-13_15>Finally, in 2007, Stewart and Penny Lancaster were wed, and they are still going strong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1077835464.jpg><p id=par-14_14>The English artist <a href=#>has eight children</a> from all of his marriages and past relationships.</p><h2>The singer’s net worth</h2><p id=par-15_13>Stewart’s net worth is an <a href=#>impressive $240 million</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p id=par-16_46>Knighted <a href=#>by Prince William</a> in 2016, Sir Roderick <a href=#>opened up to The Mail</a> about his kids’ suspicions that his third wife, Penny Lancaster, had just married him for his bags of money. He said that eventually, his wife was able to win his kids over.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-6></figure><p id=par-17_22>“Penny’s great,” he said. “She’s very grounded, but I don’t want to say normal because she’s extraordinary. She keeps the family together.”</p><p id=par-18_26>“When she first came into my life, the older kids were very suspicious. ‘Another bird trying to get her hands on Dad’s money. Less for us’.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-7></figure><p id=par-19_33>“It was that sort of thing,” he added. “But she won them all over.
