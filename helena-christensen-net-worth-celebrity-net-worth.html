The project's theme was "grace," and Christensen said of the series, "I like doing personal, very intimate projects that don't require a lot of pre-meetings. With projects of this nature, people do it because they want to. I thought it was beneficial to be at their places alone, to not have makeup and hair and lots of people around with all of that build-up."

The farmers we met and talked to are already living very hard lives, and are now being forced to adapt to the effects of the rapidly changing climate." She added, "We are at a critical tipping point. We need to put pressure on our governments in order for them to take the necessary, radical steps that are needed. There's no time left, it is absolutely imperative to act now."
