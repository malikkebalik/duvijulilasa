Groves of sacred trees were and are places for ritual practice, community, and tribal discussions (politics). Stewardship of the earth is a central common practice.</p><p>Many pre-Christian cultures had sacred groves of trees that were important to them. This may have been a small grove or an entire forest. Today indigenous communities are still fighting to protect their sacred lands.</p><p>This article will look at our relationship with the tree, how different pagan groups have honored trees throughout history, ways we can include trees in our worship today, and specific varieties of trees to seek out.</p><h2><strong>History</strong></h2><p>During the winter solstice when days were the darkest pagans would bring boughs of evergreens inside. We often hear stories of the origins of the Christmas tree.</p><p>The ancient Romans decorated the Temples with evergreens during the festivals around Saturnalia. In Egypt green rushes from palm trees were brought inside during winter to honor the God Ra.</p><p>Holly held special significance because its leaves and berries last throughout the winter.</p><p>Ancient forms of writing such as Runes were inscribed on wood.</p><p>All of these practices join us intrinsically with the natural world.</p><h2><strong>Trees in Worship</strong></h2><p>Worship among the ancients was not typically held in a building or temple. Being and worshiping nature on her terms was important.</p><p>We continue this practice today, whether we follow an ancient tradition or a neo-pagan compilation, trees are important in our practices.</p><p>Trees are sacred. As individuals, trees can be seen as spirits and have magical powers.</p><p>The Tree of Life is a powerful symbol. Trees very nicely illustrate the web of life with their strong roots and branches.</p><p>On a more scientific scale, the tree is worthy of worship because they add to life by taking in carbon dioxide and expelling oxygen. Trees are necessary to the health of the entire planet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Include Trees in Worship</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Write a prayer on a piece of paper and hang it on a branch</p></li><li><p>Trees give us shelter (wood for housing) and oxygen for life. Give thanks for trees</p></li><li><p>Touch things in your home that are wood – a piece of furniture, a wooden dish – express gratitude for the tree who made that possible</p></li><li><p>Make an offering to a tree. Hang pretty ribbons on the branches. Just loop them over the branch for the tree will share with the birds. Great in springtime.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>Family Worship of Trees</strong></h2><p>There are many activities you can do as a pagan family to <a href=#>learn more about trees</a>.</p><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Hug a tree – feel the bark and the strength of the trunk, use your senses to smell and see the tree, appreciate all the life that the tree gives</p></li><li><p>Identification – learning to id trees by their leaves and bark is not only a great science lesson but a way to get more in touch with the habitat around you.</p></li><li><p>Talk with your children about the value of trees. They provide homes for people via lumber as well as homes for many wildlife species.</p></li><li><p>Look for the Fae folk who often live amongst the roots of the trees</p></li></ul><h2><strong>How Ancient Religions Value Trees</strong></h2><h3><strong>Great Britain</strong></h3><p>The oak (Axis mundi) was a very revered tree for the Druids. Oaks that were covered in mistletoe were felt to have significant spiritual power. The ancient Runic language had letters that used tree names: ash, birch, oak, and yew.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>The word Druid means tree knowledge. They considered themselves to have descended from the trees. Men coming from the Alder (Alnus glutinosa) and women from the rowan (Sorbus aucupario)</p><p>Groves of oaks were planted and tended as sacred temples for the god Baal. Baal was the god of fire. These groves were also used for social gatherings or where the community would hold legal discussions.</p><p>Ireland gave the world the first forest management techniques. The Irish people developed laws to protect and govern the trees that included fines for misuse. They were divided into classes including, Nobles, Commoners, Lower Division, and Bushes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Germanic</strong></h2><p>Early Germanic peoples honored and worshiped trees. Sacred groves are mentioned throughout the oral history and the Roman historian Tacitus in AD 98 wrote about them extensively.</p><p>The Donor Oak was planted in the area of Hesse, to worship the god Thuner. In the 8th century during the rise of Christendom, the missionary St. Boniface, had the tree cut down and made into lumber and used to build a church.</p><p>A sacred grove planted by the Semnones in northern Germany, where they worshipped Tiwaz, god of the sky. The trees represented both birth and death and humans sometimes entered the groves bond to represent their inferiority to the trees.</p><p>In modern-day Denmark, an “island in the ocean”, the Grove of Nerthus was dedicated to the goddess Nerthus. She was a goddess of fertility and represented by the heifer (a young female cow).</p><h2><strong>Native American</strong></h2><p>Many Native Americans incorporate trees into their origin stories. The Tlingit people tell how Raven formed humans from tree leaves. Basically saying they were born from trees and established that eternal relationship.</p><p>The Koyukon believe that trees have spirits which are reflected in their stance for strong environmental justice of the natural world.</p><h3><strong>Middle East</strong></h3><p>One <a href=#>modern-day study</a> interviewed Arab, Bedouin, and Druze villages to learn more about tree worship in their communities.</p><p>They found that these people recognized both the physical and metaphysical manifestation of the tree. Trees play an important role in settling disagreements, leaving donations or things for charity under certain trees, and using trees to empower other objects.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/1621603868345-DJC57YA4PBJNEH1X4W3I/640px-Bahrain_Tree_of_Life_10.jpg><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Norse</strong></h3><p>The entire universe is seen as Yggdrasil, an Aspen tree, connecting the universe including the Gods, People, Land of the Dead, and Dwarves.</p><p>The branches and roots extend into the nine worlds and provide habitat for many creatures. These include the dragon, Niohoggr, the squirrel Ratatoskr, and several stags (deer).</p><h3><strong>Wicca</strong></h3><p>In today’s more modern Wicca, the cycle of the year, two trees battle between the dark and the light times of the year. The Oaktree is king during the dark season (winter). The Holly tree is king during the light season (summer).</p><h2><strong>Tree Species Important to Pagan Religions</strong></h2><p>All trees are important however, here are some specific trees that are easy to find in many parts of the world.</p><p>Take some time to go out in nature and find trees, identify the species and learn from them.</p><h3><strong>Banyan</strong></h3><p>The banyan tree is important in Asian religions and is revered by both Hindus and Buddhists. This unique-looking tree is in the fig family.</p><h3><strong>Birch</strong></h3><p>Choosing a favorite tree is like choosing a favorite child. However, I do love birches. The tall white birches of the northern forests, the creamy-white river birches along waterways,</p><p>The birch has been a much loved tree throughout history. A tree valued for its bark the Native Americans used the bark to writing, making canoes and smoking meats. The Ojibwa wrapped there dead in birch bark.</p><p>The Celts referred to the birch as the Lady of the Woods and with her grace and beauty, it’s easy to see why. The birch was often used for Maypoles.</p><h3><strong>Cedar</strong></h3><p>The cedar is a common tree with uncommon power. The cedar helps to channel the spirit. The Ojibwa Native Americans felt they had personhood. Cedars are often part of rituals and drum materials.</p><h3><strong>Yew</strong></h3><p>The yew is associated with death and rebirth. Groves of yews were planted because they are a very long-lived tree, symbolic of natures power, represents the seasons.</p><p>Yew trees have been dated as 1000 years old. These trees are often protected. This protection continued into Christendom and many sacred trees are protected in churchyards. The famous Totteridge yew is believed to be 2000 years old and is protected in the yard of St Andrews in London.</p><h2><strong>Take Away</strong></h2><p>Take time to worship and honor trees!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmrmaSavaKzwKefqKSZma66v42cpqZnl5q7pr7ApWapmZeWu6q%2FzGaYp5xdqb%2BmsdI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-to-recover-your-google-account-or-gmail-in-3-ways.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Recover Your Google Account or Gmail in 3 Ways</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-alanis-morissette-and-ryan-reynolds-break-up.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Did Alanis Morissette and Ryan Reynolds Break Up?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
