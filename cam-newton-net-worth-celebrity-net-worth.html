Cam was plagued with injuries during the following seasons, including a concussion, partially torn rotator cuff, and a different shoulder injury. In January 2019, he had surgery on his right shoulder, and later that season, he suffered a Lisfranc fracture in his left foot.

Newton did not find a trade partner, and the Panthers released him on March 24th; he signed with the New England Patriots three months later. He returned to the Panthers for a second stint after an injury to starting quarterback, Sam Darnold.
