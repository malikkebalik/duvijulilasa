It's such a great and beautiful city. It's also a hub for the technology and coffee sectors. It's the largest city in Washington and the metro area is home to about four million people. It's been one of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S. for years – and why not? So many parts of the Seattle-Tacoma area have gorgeous water views and despite the relative lack of sunshine for so much of the year, the region has pretty mild weather in general. It's home to the Seahawks and Sounders and Mariners. It's home to Amazon and Microsoft and Starbucks. Seattle is the northernmost large city in the U.S., located just about 100 miles south of the Canadian border. It's also home to 10 billionaires – most notably Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates – the two richest people on the planet. Is it something in the water there?</p><p><strong><a href=# title="Craig McCaw Net Worth">Craig McCaw</a> – $1.9 billion</strong></p><p>After graduating from Stanford, Craig McCaw decided to focus on rebuilding his family's struggling broadcasting company.
