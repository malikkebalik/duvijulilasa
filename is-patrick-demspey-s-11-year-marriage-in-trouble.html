Patrick Dempsey is one of those people – I could not care less about his career, whether it’s Grey’s Anatomy or the movie work he gets (for some inexplicable reason, because he’s not a good actor). I just can’t stand him. I wouldn’t describe it an “irrational hatred” – it’s more like a gut-reaction to what I perceive as his smarmy too-wholesome act. I just don’t buy that he’s a nice guy with a nice wife and a nice family. My gut has always said that there’s something “off” about him, and there’s definitely something “off” with his wife and with their marriage. Just my opinion! Or my gut, whatever.</p><p>So… this new report from Star Magazine has my gut nodding in agreement. According to Star’s sources, Patrick’s 11-year marriage is in trouble because instead of going home and spending time with his wife and kids, he trolls the gym for strange, and then hits up a bar called Swingers (seriously) without his wedding ring. Sounds about right, said my gut.</p><p>Call a marriage counselor – stat! Grey’s Anatomy hot doc Patrick Dempsey’s 11-year-union with makeup artist Jill Fink, 45, is ailing as the pair, who have three children together, are spending more and more time apart.</p><p>“Patrick has so much going on and likes to take time for himself,” says a source. “Sometimes Jillian feels like she’s stuck at home with the kids.”</p><p>So she has asked him to compromise by quitting his membership at Easton Gym in Hollywood.</p><p>“He’ll go there and start chatting with people, especially the cute girls on staff, and stay for hours,” says a source. “Then he hangs out at the diner Swingers across the street with his pals.”</p><p>What’s more, Patrick has taken to sleeping in a guest room on occasion – and even hitting the town without his wedding ring.</p><p>“Patrick brushes off concerns about problems at home and does what he wants,” says the source. “But many people in his circle think something is not right.”</p><p>[From Star Magazine, print edition]</p><p>Yeah, she should definitely ask him to rethink the “gym membership”. That part reminded of the stories about John Travolta and his spa dong. What is it about A-list LA gyms, for the love of God? Anyway, if I was married to him (gross, my gut says), I would also ask him to give up his little car-racing hobby too. There’s something odd about a 40-something man who still gets his rocks off by racing cars. And yes, I know Paul Newman did it too. I don’t care. I think it’s a stupid, expensive and tacky “hobby” for middle-aged men with families. Just buy a Porsche and bone it in the privacy of your own garage, for the love of God.</p><p>The photos of Patrick and Jill are from this past weekend, by the way. My body-language-reading skills say that Jill is sticking around for now, but that she’s got her eye on him.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wenn3248618.jpg alt=wenn3248618 title=wenn3248618 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wenn3248627.jpg alt=wenn3248627 title=wenn3248627 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wenn3237653.jpg alt=wenn3237653 title=wenn3237653 width=570 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmamxmaH55e8islqmZpKe2pLe%2BnZymq6CaxrSrkGpksp2Rp6yurdGroJqflZS2r6vTq6aumpyafA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mark-fetch-bismarck-nd-obituary-heart-attack-cause-of-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mark Fetch Bismarck ND Obituary: Heart Attack Cause Of Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-it-ok-to-release-butterflies-in-the-rain.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is it OK to release butterflies in the rain?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
