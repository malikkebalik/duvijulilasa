Sheek Louch is best known for being a member of the East Coast hip hop group the Lox alongside <a href=#>Jadakiss</a> and <a href=#>Styles P</a>. The group achieved major success with its debut album, 1998's "Money, Power & Respect," which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and was certified Platinum. In 2003, Louch launched his solo career with the album "Walk witt Me."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Sheek Louch, whose real name is Sean Jacobs, was born on September 30, 1976 in Yonkers, New York.</p><h2 id=lox><strong>The Lox</strong></h2><p>Growing up in Yonkers, Jacobs befriended Jason Phillips and David Styles. In high school, the trio formed a group called the Bomb Squad and started performing at local shows and recording demos. In 1994, the trio made an appearance on the song "Set it Off" by the hip hop group Main Source. The Bomb Squad was eventually renamed the Warlox. Fellow Yonkers native and singer <a href=#>Mary J. Blige</a> soon got ahold of the group's demo tape; impressed, she passed it along to rapper <a href=#>Sean Combs</a>, who subsequently signed the Warlox to a record deal with his Bad Boy Records label.</p><p>At Combs's urging, the group changed its name to the Lox. Jacobs adopted the stage name Sheek Louch, while Phillips became Jadakiss and Styles became Styles P. In 1996, the Lox had its first single, "Well, Well, Well," which was featured on <a href=# title="DJ Clue Net Worth">DJ Clue</a>'s mixtape "Show Me the Money." The following year, the group rose to national prominence with the multi-platinum single "We'll Always Love Big Poppa," a tribute to the late Notorious B.I.G. The Lox also collaborated with Sean Combs on the remix of his hit single "It's All About the Benjamins."</p><p>The Lox had its big breakthrough with its debut album, "Money, Power & Respect," which was released in early 1998. The album made it to number three on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart; it also spawned the hit singles "If You Think I'm Jiggy" and the title track. In early 2000, the Lox released its second album, "We Are the Streets." Another commercial success, it launched the successful singles "Wild Out" and "Ryde or Die, Bitch." Following a long break during which the members of the group worked on their own solo projects, the Lox got back together to record its debut EP, "The Trinity," which came out in 2014. That was followed by "Filthy America… It's Beautiful," the group's third studio album and first in over 16 years. The Lox's next album was "Living Off Xperience," released in the summer of 2020.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-166551 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/GettyImages-463517906.jpg alt="Sheek Louch" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-166551 class=wp-caption-text>Fernando Leon / Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-career><strong>Solo Career</strong></h2><p>During the Lox's hiatus, Louch began his career as a solo artist.
