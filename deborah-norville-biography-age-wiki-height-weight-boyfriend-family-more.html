Reporters were short of them. Thus, as a reporter, Deborah got her first big break.</p><p>In 1979, when she was given the job of questioning President Jimmy Carter, she had a big chance. More work opportunities began to come her way, and she ended up joining the ‘NBC’ station ‘WMAQ-TV’ in Chicago as their reporter. She was hired by ‘NBC News’ as an anchor after working there for a number of years.</p><p>When she was working as a full-time presenter of ‘Today’ in 1989, she had another big advance. However, following the inclusion of Deborah in ‘Today,’ the ratings of the program dipped. In 1992, she joined ‘CBS News’ as a reporter and featured in programs such as ’48 Hours’ and ‘Street Stories.’</p><p>She was appointed the solo anchor of a syndicated news magazine called ‘Inside Edition’ in 1995. Since her arrival, the show became popular and continues to run to date. Also, as a writer, Deborah has made her impact. She contributed to ‘Inside Sports.’ In March 2013, she became one of the founders of the ‘Viacom Corporation’ board of directors.</p><p>Married to Karl Wellner since the year 1987 the couple has three children their sons Niki and Kyle and their daughter Mikaela.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=2><tr><td>Boyfriends</td><td width=481>Karl Wellner</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Married</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Husband</td><td width=481 readability=5>Karl Wellner (m. 1987)<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/TransformersAgeExtinctionPremieresNYCBbfP7nQGxYGx-300x231.jpg></p></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td width=481 readability=5><strong>Son –</strong> Niki and Kyle<p><strong>Daughter –</strong> Mikaela</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Merle-O.-Norville.jpg></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you a list of Deborah Norville’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Fa<p>vorite Actress</p></td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>She was a member of the ‘Delta Delta Delta Sorority’ during her undergraduate years.</li></ul><ul><li>She also sat on the ‘Primary Court of the Student Judiciary of the University.’</li></ul><ul><li>With this exemplary educational history, she was all set to have a promising <a class=wpil_keyword_link title=future href=# data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>future</a> in the industry.</li></ul><ul><li>She won the ‘Local Junior Miss Contest’ in her neighborhood, a pageant for local senior high school students.</li></ul><ul><li>In 1976, in America’s ‘Junior Miss’ pageant, she represented her state.</li></ul><ul><li>While she did not win the pageant, it profoundly changed her life.
