Immediately following their out-of-nowhere divorce, Blake’s PR people did a number on Miranda, letting several media outlets know that Miranda was the one fooling around and that Blake had enough of it. To say it escalated quickly would be the understatement of the Summer of Splits. After a week or two, the rumors did die down. I always believed – and I still sort of believe – that Blake was no angel and that Miranda had enough dirt on him to get him to call off the smear campaign. Still… the rumors about Miranda persist. And now Star has an interesting piece about how there are still some whispers in Nashville about Miranda’s taste for married men:</p><p>Jaws dropped when fans spotted Miranda Lambert and Dierks Bentley riding together to the Music City Walk of Fame ceremony in Nashville on October 6. But it wasn’t the country stars’ fame that had the crowds whispering – it was their touchy-feely behavior! Holding hands and cuddling close in their golf cart, the pair looking more like a romantic couple than old pals – and married Dierks wasn’t wearing his wedding ring!</p><p>Now there are rumblings that Dierks’ marriage to Cassidy Black is on the rocks too. Could Miranda be to blame? Dierks and Miranda have been sharing boozy adventures for years. He even admitted to taking Miranda to a bar on the way to her 2011 wedding. But their bond seems to have intensified since she and Blake split.</p><p>“They talk nonstop these days. Since Miranda doesn’t have Blake anymore, she’s relying on Dierks for emotional support. She forgets he’s a married man and thinks it’s perfectly OK to cal or text anytime she wants.”</p><p>Cassidy, Derks’ wife of nearly a decade, has remained remarkably patient through her husband’s wild displays, but a friend says she’s nearing the end of her rope. “This buzz that Dierks and Miranda are hooking up is very upsetting for his wife. Cassidy has been with him long enough to know what he’s like, but watching his behavior with Miranda lately has really caused tension in their relationship.”</p><p>Miranda seems to have a thing for married men – during her relationship with Blake, she allegedly cheated with at least five guys, including MLB star Josh Beckett, country singer Jerrod Niemann. In 210, she reportedly tried to seduce married country star Eric Church, though he rejected her advances. And sources claim that shortly before she split from Blake, Miranda fell for a married man who worked for her.</p><p>[From Star Magazine, print edition]</p><p>At this point, there are so many rumors about Miranda and her attraction to married men that I sort of believe it. Blake was married too when he first got with Miranda. She was forgiven for that, mostly because Blake is popular and beloved and he has dimples. But it feels like Miranda only gets one of those. If she is this indiscreet and it comes out in the mainstream press outlets like People Magazine that she’s going after married men, her career is done. She really wouldn’t be forgiven. The public will forgive it one time if a lady bangs a married man. The public will not forgive it twice (or several times, which is what it’s starting to sound like).</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/wenn21697756.jpg alt=wenn21697756 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/wenn22163054.jpg alt=wenn22163054 width=490 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN, Getty.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbW1iZn53e9KtmKuXnZ6%2ForrDmpalmZ2XsrPAvpymrqSUlK%2Bmq8WopqWhnpysor7OrqWdl6eewamrzJqpq6GVmayltcSroqyXkpq7tbjEsmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taya-kyle-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taya Kyle Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sean-giambrone-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sean Giambrone Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
