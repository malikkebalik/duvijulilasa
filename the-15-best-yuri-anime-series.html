Yuri has always been for everyone, but it can often feel like the most popular yuri works aren’t made for the sapphics, lesbians, and bisexual girls it represents. So this list is for all of you, too. Some of the best yuri — including anime shows, films, OVAs, and ONAs — are gathered below. I promise heartbreak, not queerbait.</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false>As with all my lists, there’s no particular order below (except for number one).</p><h2 id=h-liz-and-the-bluebird data-injectable=false>Liz and the Bluebird</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=382 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=663 data-current-count=1045 data-injectable=true>One day I will stop crying over this movie. Not only is Liz and the Bluebird one of the best yuri anime, but also one of the best sapphic dramas on the silver screen, period. From the same team that produced the critically acclaimed film adaptation of A Silent Voice, director Naoko Yamada and writer Reiko Yoshida flaunt their ability to represent the dramatics of girlhood in a production that has more in common with the work of Céline Sciamma than the moe slice-of-life the pair is best known for. Composer Kensuke Ushio returns as well, scoring a soundtrack that feels just as important as all the (un)spoken words between bandmates Mizore and Nozome.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=57 data-current-count=57 data-injectable=false>Okay, I need to go cry before I finish writing this list.</p><h2 id=h-kanamewo data-injectable=false>kanamewo</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=669 data-current-count=1026 data-injectable=true>Kanamewo is an indie short film by webgen animator <a href=#>rapparu</a>. In just five minutes, a young woman finds a tree goddess whose home has been destroyed by construction, falls in love with her, and, well, spoilers. Maternal love transforms into romantic love as the two live together, and this short artfully glimpses their relationship’s further transformation into sexual love. There are no words, just the accompaniment of a shoegaze-y track that matches the wave of emotions accompanying this feat of storytelling. Released in 2015, kanamewo caught fire among fans of both yuri and animation in general, and it’s just as devastating today as it was six years ago.</p><h2 id=h-kase-san-morning-glories data-injectable=false>Kase-san & Morning Glories</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=828 data-current-count=1128 data-injectable=true>An OVA adaptation of the popular manga series Kase San, Kase San & Morning Glories is about a budding romance between a cottage core femme and a sporty girl in their last year of high school. The characters and dialogue are exceedingly human. They have big feelings for each other but all their fears—the future, being alone together, seeing the other at a bath on a class trip—&nbsp;are all recognizable. It also <a href=#>tows a line</a> that the medium, and yuri especially, seem to find difficult: These girls are teenagers that are interested in each other’s bodies. Years later, I can remember how Yui’s friend casually asks if they’ve slept together, like it’s a completely normal thing for these teenagers to do. Such mundanity is something I didn’t realize was missing from much of yuri until I saw it here.</p><h2 id=h-fragtime data-injectable=false>Fragtime</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=623 data-current-count=923 data-injectable=true>Another OVA adaptation of a manga, Fragtime is about two girls that connect across social distance. Misuzu Moritani is a shy high schooler with the introverted superpower to stop time for a few minutes every day, which she uses to escape awkward social interactions. One day she finds Haruka Murakami, a popular girl at their school, frozen in time and approaches her. But somehow, Murikami remains unaffected by Moritani’s power, and the two end up connecting over their shared feelings of not really fitting in. Together in time, they’ll tear each other’s masks down and seek the better person each is drawn to.</p><h2 id=h-sakura-trick data-injectable=false>Sakura Trick</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Sakura Trick is another slice-of-life romcom, but with requited feelings (and high schoolers—it’s a tradeoff). Sakura Trick looks at that moment in a young queer’s life when she realizes she likes her best friend differently than her other friends. What begins as Haruka and Yū’s innocent exploration of affection transforms into a budding romance, and all that that entails in high school.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-sweet-blue-flowers data-injectable=false>Sweet Blue Flowers</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=838 data-injectable=true>Sweet Blue Flowers is defined by its confrontation with vulnerability. A story about high schoolers stumbling through big, fragile feelings, its cast of girls are out, coming out, or trying to support their friends. They come together, but often hurt each other with unrequited feelings and mixed responses to the normative expectations imposed on them. Sweet Blue Flowers depicts a quiet kind of love, with scenes of intimacy between lovers, exes, and friends that had me asking “How do they know?” on more than one occasion.</p><h2 id=h-revolutionary-girl-utena data-injectable=false>Revolutionary Girl Utena</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=820 data-injectable=true>Revolutionary Girl Utena is an undisputed shojo classic. Building off the success of shojo like Sailor Moon and its depiction of a lesbian relationship among side characters, Utena puts sapphic love in the spotlight. The titular Utena Tenjou is also a gender nonconforming icon, an almost unbelievable representation of androgyny and queer fashion in the late ‘90s. You can see the prevailing influence of Utena on contemporary animation most clearly in Rebecca Sugar’s Steven Universe and Noel Stevenson’s She-Ra.</p><h2 id=h-bloom-into-you data-injectable=false>Bloom Into You</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=812 data-current-count=1112 data-injectable=true>Bloom Into You may be the most popular yuri of recent memory that isn’t totally ruined by the male gaze, but this adaptation sacrifices much of what makes the manga so important to fit a single season’s run time. Yuu Koito is waiting for love to sweep her off her feet, as it does in the shojo she reads. When the student council president Touko Nanami pursues her, Yuu has to reckon with her sexuality. Yuu’s characterization in the anime has also drawn many ace fans, as the series ends before the two commit to being together. Unfortunately, you’ll have to look elsewhere to see them come together in a consensual, mutual relationship. Stretching much further into Yuu and Touko’s future, the manga better gets the message across that love is something that requires time, trust, and friendship.</p><h2 id=h-miss-kobayashi-s-dragon-maid data-injectable=false>Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=676 data-current-count=976 data-injectable=true>While Dragon Maid has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fraught relationship</a> with queerness, it’s one of the few popular yuri about adults. Like its source manga, this is a slice-of-life story about the dragon Tohru, who works as a maid for a human woman named Kobayashi. Shenanigans ensue. As Tohru and Kobayashi learn to live together, the stakes of their conflicts range from making a weeknight dinner to the fate of the human world. Tohru has an arguably unrequited love for Kobayashi, who always seems to be coming around on her but never getting closer to actually being with Tohru. It’s nice to see adult problems and frank confrontations with sex in yuri, but we could really have so much better.</p><h2 id=h-hibike-euphonium data-injectable=false>Hibike! Euphonium</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=736 data-current-count=1036 data-injectable=true>Before Naoko Yamada made Liz and the Bluebird, she co-directed the first season of Kyoto Animation’s Hibike! Euphonium adaptation with Tatsuya Ishihara. A unique mixture of slice-of-life and sports anime, the show is about an almost-all-girls high school concert band trying to win a national competition and all the drama that ensues. It’s intensely reminiscent of high school bands in America, too, but what even more fans have latched onto is the undoubtedly queer nature of the protagonist Kumiko’s relationship with the standoffish virtuoso, Reina. While we await a final installment, the hope that their outspoken relationship will be made explicitly queer grows. I know I said no queerbait, but this ship hasn’t sunk yet.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Adachi and Shimamura</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=780 data-injectable=true>Adachi and Shimamura is a good viewing option for those who like a slower burn. Based on Hitoma Iruma’s light novel series of the same name, anime depicts the realistic development of a relationship, from the two protagonists’ first meeting to the friendship that ensues. While wildly different, Adachi and Shimamura find it commonplace when they’re together, and as time allows them to grow closer, Adachi develops and struggles to express her undeniable romantic feelings.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Whispered Words</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=557 data-current-count=857 data-injectable=true>Heartbreak was promised at the beginning of this article, and Whispered Words delivers it. The story mainly focuses on the dynamic between Murasame Sumika and her friend, Kazama Ushio, with whom the protagonist is secretly in love with. Unfortunately, Ushio only has eyes for cutesy girls and seems utterly blind to Sumika’s feelings, choosing to pursue other crushes, only to get hurt by them. This anime portrays a cycle of loneliness to a T and the unique suffering of one-sided love. At least the lesbian side-couple is happy, so it’s not all angst.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Strawberry Panic!</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=581 data-current-count=881 data-injectable=true>Strawberry Panic! is a staple in yuri anime and a favorite of many viewers. The story revolves around Nagisa Aoi, who has just transferred to an all-girls school, where she meets the gorgeous Shizuma Hanazono. The two quickly become the talk of the school, as Shizuma openly shows interest in the new girl; however, something feels slightly off. Over the course of 21 episodes, this anime perfectly portrays the experience of uncovering new feelings and possibilities, while balancing slice-of-life content with an overall feeling of suspense. Needless to say, it’s a must-watch.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>El Cazador de la Bruja</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=826 data-injectable=true>If action is more your style, you might want to give El Cazador de la Bruja a shot. This is an original anime that mostly takes place in Mexico, portraying the journey of Nadie, a bounty hunter, and Ellis, an amnesiac girl with supernatural powers, who is suspected of murder. When the two meet, they set off on a risky adventure to uncover Ellis’ past, and while road-tripping and fighting off enemies, they slowly built a friendship, and eventually fall in love. Guns, violence, and romance — what more could we ask for?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Konohana Kitan</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=578 data-current-count=878 data-injectable=true>Konohana Kitan is full of whimsy and wonder. Through the eyes of the teenage fox girl Yuzu, viewers are introduced to a fantastical world, derived from Japanese folklore. As Yuzu gets used to working at a hot springs inn, she meets a cast of equally wonderful characters, with whom she forms great attachments. Granted, the focus of this anime is more on the folklore aspect, but it includes some truly heartwarming dynamics and moments between its female cast, which is enough to please many fans. Sometimes, love doesn’t have to be center stage to make something worthwhile.</p><p data-characters=123 data-current-count=123 data-injectable=false>There’s a lot more to explore in the world of yuri anime, but starting with this list will likely ensure a good time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55lkprAtXnYrqmiZZGjtq6xjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-s-next-for-tully-and-kate.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What's Next for Tully and Kate?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hansel-gretel-get-baked-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hansel &amp;amp; Gretel Get Baked Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
