If you look at it correctly, the ‘hating Gojo bandwagon’ is more of a stick he adheres to than his absolute stance. Sure, he might’ve told fans to vote for everyone’s beloved salaryman, Kento Nanami, over Satoru Gojo for the popularity pool after the white-haired Sensei had won a previous pool by a landslide, but hating the strongest modern jujutsu sorcerer seems to be more of a fun posture to adopt than an actual mark of resentment for the character.</p><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>One thing that cannot be avoided, however, is that Gojo’s overpowered nature is an obstacle to the story’s progression. Hence it made sense for Akutami, when the manga was releasing chapters of the Shibuya Arc and Gojo got sealed, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to celebrate online</a> that “Now that Gojo is gone, it’s looking like 2020’s gonna be a great year.” At one point, we all just expected Akutami’s classic ‘Gojo hater’ commentary every once in a while. It almost seems like he gets a kick out of shocking his fans with his unpopular opinions on the beloved character.</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>My main point of contention to the claim that Akutami actually hates the character he created, is how he managed to make him undeniably likable, being that “likable” is a clear understatement. The complexities of his personality are well-delineated and his relationship with his best friend Suguru Geto is soulful and manages to touch most of us.</p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=945 data-injectable=true>So, when Akutami called Gojo “a man of resignation,” it wasn’t said in a condescending manner or intended to be an insult. It was a description of a posture the bearer of the Six Eyes adopts in life, particularly in the face of adversity or unfavorable outcomes. It might be difficult to understand, and it may even seem paradoxical at first, how someone who has the power to take down a country by himself could also have a tendency for resignation — accepting that one cannot change what’s outside of their control. But both these aspects are at play in the character of Satoru Gojo.</p><h2 id=h-what-does-the-resignation-mean-for-gojo data-injectable=false>What does the “resignation” mean for Gojo?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/8762587-1-1-1-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>The quote of Gege Akutami calling Satoru Gojo “a man of resignation” was recently revived by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Twitter user,</a> who often posts Japanese to English translations pertaining to the series. So, what does the word mean in the context of this particular character?</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>First of all, we can understand resignation as falling almost into a sense of Buddhist acceptance or a somewhat stoic posture to adversity. It certainly doesn’t mean the resignation of one’s ego — Gojo’s too big for that.</p><p data-characters=649 data-current-count=878 data-injectable=true>Going chronologically — in the series’ temporality not by release date — Gojo’s first moment of resignation is when he fails to kill his best friend, Geto, at the end of Hidden Inventory. This resignation stands out from the others because the emotional heaviness lingers rather than being almost fully and immediately dispelled, giving rise to a moment of self-reflection. The shot of Satoru sitting on the steps when being approached by Masamichi Yaga is a picture of resignation while not meaning that he isn’t still feeling burdened. This moment marks a shift because thereafter, Gojo’s resignation is freer from the bounds of guilt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Captura-de-ecra-2023-10-15-141006-1-1-1.png><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>From then on, Gojo’s posture is more of a “Whatever I can do, I’ll do” — finally killing Geto when it comes to that — “and what I can’t do, I won’t sweat it.”</p><p data-characters=675 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>In the Shibuya Arc, when he gets captured by the prison realm, he admits to checkmate without too much resistance. The unusual rage he momentarily shows doesn’t come from the inability to fight back and free himself, but from knowing that the man who entrapped him and is now standing in front of him is callously wearing his deceased best friend’s body. There’s no better example of Gojo’s carefree resignation in the anime than when he’s already sealed, chilling inside the prison realm, laying back amongst the sea of skeletons, casually playing with his headband, and going: “Man, I screwed up. This is all kinds of bad. Well, it’ll work out somehow!”</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=false>In what we may call the dream sequence of manga <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chapter 236, Gojo isn’t combative of the fate he got</a>. Sure, he shows some annoyance, but that’s more of an immediate reaction rather than his perspective on his loss. In fact, he goes as far as to imply to Yaga that the former Principal was wrong in saying that “No Jujutsu sorcerer dies without regrets,” as he, Satoru Gojo, the strongest sorcerer of the modern age, is proof to the contrary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn7JllKSytHnGnp6eZZGgwrWtzKJknJmcoXqou8moZJplnZa7brvFZqmeq5mcu6LAyKilZqGeYre2ttStqq5lm5a2tLHNaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./raising-spirits-star-theresa-caputo-is-rumored-to-be-in-love-again.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'Raising Spirits' Star Theresa Caputo Is Rumored to Be in Love Again</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mario-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mario Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
