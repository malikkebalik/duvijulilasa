Ickey Woods is best remembered for his end zone celebration called the "Ickey Shuffle" that he performed each time he scored a touchdown. His first season with the Cincinnati Bengals set numerous rookie franchise records, but injuries cut his NFL career short after just four seasons.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Elbert L. Woods was born on February 28, 1966, in Fresno, California, where he attended Edison High School and played multiple sports. He received one college scholarship, from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Ickey was a four-year letterwinner for the UNLV Rebels. In his senior year of 1987, Woods led the nation in rushing with 1,658 yards on 6.4 yards per attempt. As of today, it remains the second-most in Rebels history, and he still holds the school record for single-game rushing attempts with 37 in two different games. Woods rushed for more than 100 yards in nine games, and 200 yards in three games. He was named First-Team All Big West in 1987. In 1998, Ickey Woods was inducted into the UNLV Athletic Hall of Fame.</p><h2 id=nfl-career><strong>NFL Career</strong></h2><p>With the 31st overall pick in the second round of the 1988 NFL Draft, Ickey Woods was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals. In his first season, Ickey was an All-Pro selection and won an AFC Championship with the Bengals. That same year he was the AFC Rushing Touchdowns Leader and finished second in the NFL in touchdowns with 15. Woods set the franchise rookie rushing record of 1,066 yards (since broken by <a href=# title="Corey Dillon Net Worth">Corey Dillon</a>) and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team. In the 1989 season, he tore his left anterior cruciate ligament in the second game and missed over a year. He injured his right knee in the preseason in 1991 and did not play much after that. By the age of 26, Woods was out of football. He was named the #7 NFL Top Ten One-Shot Wonders.</p><p>Ickey Woods ended his NFL career with 1,525 rushing yards for an average of 4.6 yards per carry to go along with 27 touchdowns.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-252932 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/GettyImages-72284538.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-252932 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=other-ventures><strong>Other Ventures</strong></h2><p>After retiring from the NFL, Woods has been a sales representative for a meat company, sold security systems, and has owned a flooring store in Cincinnati. In 2006, Ickey was an assistant coach for the Cincinnati Marshals of the National Indoor Football League.</p><p>Woods has appeared in many commercials over the years in which he performed his signature dance, the "Ickey Shuffle." Namely in 2014, he was featured in a national GEICO Insurance commercial in which he did the dance while buying cold cuts at a deli counter.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Ickey Woods was once married to Chandra Baldwin, one of the players he coached on the Cincinnati Sizzle, the team he owned in the full-contact Women's Football Alliance.
