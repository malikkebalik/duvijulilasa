In 2002, he snagged a role in National Lampoon’s&nbsp;Van Wilder, and he met the singer the same year.</p><p id=par-4_44>The Canadian entertainers reportedly met at Drew Barrymore’s birthday party in Feb. of that year, and they were joined at the hip moving forward. Known for being extremely passionate on red carpets and events, the Deadpool actor popped the question in June 2004.</p><p id=par-5_35>&nbsp;“He’s like a soul brother to me,” the singer told <a href=#>People</a> at the time. “Except that I want to jump his bones.” However, just three years later, the duo ended their engagement and split.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Ryan Reynolds and Alanis Morissette have both moved on</h2><p id=par-6_59>Shortly after the split was announced in 2007, Reynolds began dating actress Scarlett Johansson. The pair wed in 2008 and were divorced by July 2011. By then, The Proposal actor had already been romantically linked to his Green Lantern co-star, Blake Lively. The actors wed in 2014 and they have three little girls together, Inez, James, and Betty.</p><p id=par-7_25>For her part, Morissette also found love again.

I was a full-blown love addict, so it was like, ‘I can’t keep doing this, my body can’t take it.’ For someone who is a love addict, [breakups are] debilitating. I’ve been on a constant journey toward finally surrendering and hitting the rock bottom that I’ve been avoiding my whole life . . . So this was a huge, critical juncture for me. Everything broke, and it was an amazing and horrifying time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSura3NoqpmpZ%2BntrS%2FxK2rnmWirq6vedGesKennJnAb7TTpqNo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paganism-and-trees.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paganism and Trees</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./mrs-american-pie-with-kristen-wiig-laura-dern-coming-to-apple-tv-plus.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Mrs. American Pie with Kristen Wiig, Laura Dern coming to Apple TV Plus</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
