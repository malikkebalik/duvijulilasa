She seems to have expressed divisive viewpoints on every political topic imaginable. In addition, she’s known for feuding with fellow celebrities online.</p><p id=par-2_37>Some fans feel <a href=#>Banks</a>’ controversies have overshadowed her music. Some people, particularly in the United States, have heard of Banks but haven’t heard any of her songs. This raises an interesting question: What is <a href=#>Banks</a>’ net worth?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/azealia.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Azealia Banks’ early years</h2><p id=par-3_66>According to the <a href=#>BBC</a>, Banks was born on May 31, 1991. She was raised in Harlem. <a href=#>AllMusic</a> reports she wanted to be a performer at a young age and she went to a school for the performing arts. Today, <a href=#>Banks</a>’ output is primarily a combination of rap, R&B, and house music. However, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that, in her early years, Banks performed in off-Broadway musicals.</p><p id=par-4_28>Then <a href=#>Banks</a> made the pivot to the television industry. She began trying to get TV work. However, she decided she didn’t like the industry after auditioning for commercials.</p><p id=par-5_48>In 2008, she began releasing music on the internet. For Banks, making hip-hop music seemed like a good alternative to television. Three years later, she was signed to XL Records. That’s quite an accomplishment for a 17-year-old! At such a young age, Banks was already a showbusiness veteran.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career breakthrough and debut album</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/azealia-banks-in-a-black-outfit.jpg><p id=par-6_73>After releasing several singles, Banks released a song called “212.” The song was a tad unconventional. It was a hip house song at a time when hip house was not a very popular genre. It also had an incredibly vulgar chorus. However, it caught the attention of Pitchfork and other major music websites. According to the <a href=#>Official Charts Company</a>, the track reached the twelfth spot on the British pop charts in 2012.</p><p id=par-7_51>2012 was also the year Banks released her mixtape Fantasea. Banks now had a sizeable internet following. It would take her two years to release her debut studio album, Broke with Expensive Taste. Banks released a second mixtape, Slay-Z, two years later, however, she has yet to release a sophomore album.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Azealia Banks’ subsequent career, feuds, and net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>“Anna Wintour” by Azealia Banks</figure><p id=par-8_14><strong>RELATED</strong>: <strong><a href=#>Will Azealia Banks Be on the Next Season of the HBO Series, ‘Euphoria’?</a></strong></p><p id=par-9_58>Banks has said the album will be called Fantasea II: The Second Wave. She released the album’s lead single “Anna Wintour,” in 2018. Although Banks managed to earn a top 40 hit on the British charts, she has not done so since. Her second most successful single on the British charts, “1991,” reached number 79 on the chart.</p><p id=par-10_74>Any discussion of Banks’ career would be incomplete without a discussion of her controversial online feuds. There are numerous articles across the internet about the many people she’s called out and insulted. Some of the famous names on the list include Rihanna, Beyonce, Cardi B, Zayn Malik, Kendrick Lamar, Angel Haze, and <a href=#>Lana Del Rey</a>. Although she might be more known for her feuds than her music, she’s still worth an enviable $3 million.</p><p id=par-11_18><strong>Also see:</strong> <strong><a href=#>Azealia Banks Goes On Rant About Men in the Industry and Claims Affair with Dave Chappelle</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSuu7HApaCaZZKWu6y%2FjLCfmqxdnsBuwMeeZJynnqm%2FsMLEq6qimZxiv6K8z56prGWemsFuw86rq6FmmKm6rXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./which-lead-actor-has-the-highest-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Which Lead Actor Has the Highest Net Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./tommy-tuberville-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Tommy Tuberville Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
