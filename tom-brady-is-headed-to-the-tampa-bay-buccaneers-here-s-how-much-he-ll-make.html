The three-time MVP has agreed to a deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, marking the end of his tenure with the New England Patriots. And Brady's new deal comes with quite the raise.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two-year contract is worth a reported $30 million per season. Brady made $23 million with the Patriots last year, and signed with the caveat that the team couldn't franchise tag him this year. When Brady scored a big deal from the Bucs, he couldn't pass it up.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Brady's new team might offer him one of the best receiving corps he's ever had. Chris Godwin (95.2) and <a href=# title="Mike Evans Net Worth">Mike Evans</a> (89.0) each finished in the top four in receiving yards per game. And Breshad Perriman, who played a bigger role when Evans and Godwin got hurt, had 20 catches for 419 yards and five touchdowns in the final four games of the season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Add tight ends O.J. Howard and Cameron Brate – big, physical players who have shown flashes of greatness – and Brady's arsenal of weapons runs deep.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295675 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GettyImages-487641290.jpg alt width=900 height=613 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295675 class=wp-caption-text>Jim Rogash/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>On the flip side, the Tampa Bay offensive line doesn't rate as highly as New England's does. Brady may have less time to get the ball out to his talented receivers.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Even so, Brady provides an upgrade over <a href=# title="Jameis Winston Net Worth">Jameis Winston</a>. Winston became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 interceptions in one season, and Buccaneers head coach <a href=# title="Bruce Arians Net Worth">Bruce Arians</a> was frustrated by the former No. 1 overall pick's inconsistency. Brady may no longer be elite, but he's still a great decision-maker and can make tough throws when needed.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, Brady will look to give the Bucs their first Super Bowl victory since the 2002 season. Perhaps in a fitting coincidence, that was the same season Brady entered the year as the Patriots' full-time starter.</span></p><p>Between 2000 and 2019 while Tom was with the Patriots, he earned earned $230 million in his career from salary alone. In the same time period he earned approximately $100 million from endorsements. During the same period <a href=#>Gisele Bundchen's career earnings were nearly $500 million</a>.</p><p>By the time his two year deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ends, he will have earned a minimum of $280 million in salary and $140 million from endorsements. So by the end of his career, Tom Brady's career earnings should top $420 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2mpmWSp66lxYyiqmaglZaxprCMraZmrJiaerWtzKmYZpqRrnqjwcKcmKedlafAbrTEq5ysZZikxG651JyfZqCVobluucCknGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./treat-williams-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Treat Williams Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jill-duggar-dillard-says-her-family-s-church-is-a-cult-here-s-why.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jill Duggar Dillard Says Her Family's Church Is a 'Cult' Here's Why</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
