Depicted by a bow-wielding archer, the zodiac sign’s overall aura is both independent and imaginative.</p><p>“Sagittarius is a sign that has many sides to them,” <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Karolina Sucre</a>, a Miami-based astrologer known for her viral astro-centric TikToks, tells Bustle. “They are a really playful, curious sign, and they tend to be fearless and excited to come across trends that are expressive of their personality.”</p><p>As for a few famed Sagittarians who epitomize of the adventure-loving fire sign? <a href=# class=T3D>Taylor Swift</a>, <a href=# class=T3D>Britney Spears</a>, <a href=# class=T3D>Nicki Minaj</a>, <a href=# class=T3D>Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href=# class=T3D>Christina Aguilera</a>, and the fictitious <a href=# class=T3D>Emily of Emily In Paris</a> are only a few beloved Sagittarius women worth mentioning.</p><p>In line with the sign’s vibrant personal and rich intellect, the color palette typically associated with Sags includes <a href=# class=T3D>fire red</a>, deep royal purple, golden yellow, and hints of turquoise blue (which is a nod to their birthstone).</p><p>When it comes to nail art details, Sagittarians seldom shy away from a bold statement. “One minute, they're the happy-go-lucky optimist sporting a bright yellow mani, and then the next they're deep in thought, hiding under a tree on their third book of the day, flipping their pages with their fingers in <a href=# class=T3D>a deep cherry maroon</a>.”</p><p>Alongside mirror-like chrome finishes and 3D details, Sucre notes: “<a href=# class=T3D>Checkerboard nails</a>, bold colors, and even a mix-and-match set would be perfect for a sign that has a hard time making up their mind.”</p><p>Below, find the trendiest nail art designs for Sagittarius season 2023, from red-hot flames to chrome micro cherries.</p><h2>Megan Thee Stallion’s Sharp Tips</h2><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Steve Granitz/FilmMagic/Getty Images</p></figure><p>On Nov. 16, Megan Thee Stallion attended the 2023 GQ Men Of The Year event.
