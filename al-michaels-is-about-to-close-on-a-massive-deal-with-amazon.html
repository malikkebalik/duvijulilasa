His broadcast partner <a href=# title="Joe Buck Net Worth">Joe Buck</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>shortly followed suit</a>. Both are receiving huge deals from ESPN to do so—Aikman's is worth $18.5 annually over five years, while Buck is expected to make $60 to $75 million across his five-year deal.</p><p>Now, it looks like <a href=# rel=noopener>Al Michaels</a> is moving from NBC to Amazon, where he'll call Thursday night games for Prime Video. And he's also going to get paid very well.</p><p>The New York Post's Andrew Marchand, who's been reporting on all of these broadcast moves, <a href=# rel=noopener>says</a> the "deal is at [the] half yard line." At first, Michaels was reportedly only calling 11 of 16 games for Amazon. For that, he'd make $30 million over three years, or $10 million annually. On a per-game basis, his deal would be similar to the ones Aikman and <a href=# title="Tony Romo Net Worth">Tony Romo</a> received. Michaels would be bringing in almost $1 million per game.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-330033 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-903095666.jpg alt width=900 height=633 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-330033 class=wp-caption-text>Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</p><p>However, <a href=# rel=noopener>Marchand added</a> that the $30 million was for 11 games. Michaels is now expected to call all 16 Amazon broadcasts, which could push his total salary even higher. It's not out of the realm of possibilities that Michaels could make $12 to $14 million per year with the added workload.</p><p>Marchand originally reported that Michaels, 77, was waiting to see who Amazon would bring on as his broadcast partner. Among the initial short list of potential options were San Francisco 49ers GM and former analyst <a href=# title="John Lynch Net Worth">John Lynch</a>, Los Angeles Rams head coach <a href=# title="Sean McVay Net Worth">Sean McVay</a>, and former quarterbacks <a href=# title="Drew Brees Net Worth">Drew Brees</a> and <a href=#>Tom Brady</a>.</p><p>McVay <a href=# rel=noopener>turned down a $100 million deal</a> from Amazon to remain head coach of the Rams. And as you may know, Tom Brady <a href=# rel=noopener>just decided to unretire from football</a>. Both of those options are already out.</p><p>No matter who ends up joining Michaels in the broadcast booth, he's going to make a ton of money to keep doing what he loves. That's a nice gig on any network.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjpqjZqWZmLWiscusZKKrXZavsMHTZquoZZOhvLSxjKilZpldoq60v8ivnGaclZa5bsPIrZ9mmZ2Wx7C6jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bryce-harper-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bryce Harper Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-charlie-wilson-dating-charlie-wilson-s-wife-exes.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Charlie Wilson Dating Charlie Wilson's Wife &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
