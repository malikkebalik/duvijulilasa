She wrote in her 2009 book that she had to tattoo the image upside down.</li><li><strong>666</strong>: Inked next to her skull design (after the above photo was taken), the number tattoo was a matching one Von D had with Scott Ian of Anthrax, Kirk Hammett of Metallica, and other musicians.</li><li><strong>Repiola</strong>: As Von D explained in her book, "repiola" is an Argentinian expression that roughly translates to "really cool" or "really good." Her mom tattooed it on her daughter's leg at a tattoo convention "in front of thousands of people" because it's her "fave word," Von D said.</li><li><strong>Oliver Peck portrait</strong>: Von D had a tattoo of her first husband at the top of her left thigh. They were married between 2003 and 2006.</li><li><strong>J:&nbsp;</strong>Von D's first tattoo was a thick letter J near her ankle.
