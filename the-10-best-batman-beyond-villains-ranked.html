In the beloved cyberpunk-flavored series, an elderly Bruce Wayne trains up cocky high school kid Terry McGinnis to be the new Batman and to take down a whole host of new threats to what is now called Neo-Gotham/</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>Honestly, even more so than getting audiences to care about a Batman who wasn’t Bruce, the biggest challenge Beyond faced was in building up a brand-new robust rogues gallery that could measure up to what is one of the absolute finest in both comics and pop culture at large. The genius move taken by the showrunners was to borrow from another iconic rogues gallery instead. With Terry possessing many similarities to Peter Parker, so do many of his villains mirror memorable Spider-Man foes.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>Across three seasons of 52 episodes, Batman Beyond was a fountain of creativity and cool ideas, one that has stubbornly refused to spawn a big-screen spinoff — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">despite how epic one would be</a>. So how about we set one of these 10 terrific villains from the show’s run on Warner Bros. execs until they finally give us a movie?</p><h2 id=h-10-robert-vance data-injectable=false>10. Robert Vance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/robert-vance-batman-beyond.png><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>Don’t be fooled by his lack of a supervillain alias, Robert Vance is one of the most dangerous and inhuman foes Terry McGinnis ever faced. Once the brilliant CEO of a tech company, Vance was diagnosed with an incurable brain disorder that led him to digitize his mind. His hunger for power grew, however, and he manipulated his grandson, Terry’s schoolmate Bobby, into hooking him up to the net. His most impressive feat, though? Taking control of the batsuit itself, leaving Terry to fight it with just his bare knuckles and wits.</p><h2 id=h-9-royal-flush-gang data-injectable=false>9. Royal Flush Gang</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/batman-beyond-ten-1.jpg><p data-characters=541 data-current-count=841 data-injectable=true>Batman Beyond introduced a new incarnation of classic DC supervillain group the Royal Flush Gang, reimagining them as a family of crooks with hi-tech gadgets. Flying around on hoverboards shaped like playing cards, the Gang consisted of King, Queen, Jack, their android Ace, and Ten. Ten, aka Melanie Walker, is what really lifts the Royal Flush Gang. Very much Terry’s counterpart to Catwoman — or Black Cat, in Spider-Man terns — Terry and Melanie were very attracted to each other despite existing on opposite sides of the law.</p><h2 id=h-8-shriek data-injectable=false>8. Shriek</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/shriek-batman-beyond-1.jpg><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>Sometimes Batman Beyond didn’t even try to hide its Spider-Man influences. Marvel fans will be familiar with Shocker, the Spidey baddie who uses sonic tech to commit crimes. Well, meet Shriek, the Batman Beyond baddie who… uses sonic tech to commit crimes. What he lacks in originality, though, Shriek makes up for with his nifty design and the exploration of tech corrupting human nature being one of the series’ key themes.</p><h2 id=h-7-dee-dee-and-the-jokerz data-injectable=false>7. Dee Dee (and the Jokerz)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/dee-dee-batman-beyond-e1708514964263.jpg><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=731 data-injectable=true>By the time of Batman Beyond, the Joker has become an unlikely icon for the next generation and the biggest gang of criminal youths operating in the city are the Jokerz. The two most memorable Jokerz are Dee Dee, a pair of mischievous, acrobatic twins who serve as henchwomen for the various Jokerz gang leaders. In Return of the Joker, we find out it runs in the family — Dee Dee are actually the granddaughters of Harley Quinn!</p><h2 id=h-6-curare data-injectable=false>6. Curaré</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/curare-batman-beyond.png><p data-characters=546 data-current-count=846 data-injectable=true>Ra’s al-Ghul and his League (or Society) of Assassins returned for Batman Beyond, so he almost earned a spot on this list, but let’s give the placement to the show’s original Society of Assassins creation instead — Curaré, a strikingly designed and conceived character. A mute, blue-skinned woman who covers her unseen but apparently horrific face behind a niqab, the Spider-Man villain Curaré is inspired by takes a moment to figure out — as her mission is to hunt and kill Batman, she is Terry’s answer to Kraven.</p><h2 id=h-5-spellbinder data-injectable=false>5. Spellbinder</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/spellbinder-batman-beyond-1.jpg><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=766 data-injectable=true>Not all Terry’s foes match Peter Parker’s, though. Sometimes they are very much proxies for the villains faced by his own mentor, Bruce. Spellbinder, for example, feels like the successor to the mantle of Jonathan Crane aka Scarecrow, only with more monetary goals in mind. An embittered psychiatrist working at Terry’s high school, he uses his knowledge of the mind (and sometimes VR tech) to hypnotize the schoolkids to steal from their parents.</p><h2 id=h-4-starro data-injectable=false>4. Starro</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/starro-superman-batman-beyond.jpg><p data-characters=563 data-current-count=863 data-injectable=true>Seeing as Starro the Conqueror was the very first villain the Justice League faced in the comics, it was a stroke of genius to make Starro the villain of the Justice League’s first story in the DCAU. In season 2’s “The Call,” Batman Beyond finally joins the Justice League Unlimited but discovers a terrible secret — for the past 10 years, Superman and the League have been controlled by the psychic squid who has been stealthily invading the planet! Yes, Batman Beyond proved how sinister Starro could be long before The Suicide Squad.</p><h2 id=h-3-inque data-injectable=false>3. Inque</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/batman-beyond-inque-1.jpg><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=774 data-injectable=true>A seductive femme fatale whose body is made up of an inky, gloopy substance, Inque is what happens if you blend together Poison Ivy and Marvel’s Venom. A mercenary who submitted to an experiment to give her shapeshifting abilities, Inque is one of Terry’s most mysterious and troublesome foes, who even got some much-needed nuance when her daughter, Deanna, was introduced. Inque has to be the single most popular Batman Beyond villain when it comes to fan art.</p><h2 id=h-2-joker-2 data-injectable=false>2. Joker 2</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/batman-beyond-return-of-the-joker-e1708515379157.jpg><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=856 data-injectable=true>You can’t have any incarnation of Batman without the Joker, so on the face of it the spinoff movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker </a>seems like a lazy cash-in. However, the film might just be Beyond‘s finest hour as it introduces a unique, tragic, and truly dark incarnation of the Crown Prince of Crime. Decades after his death, the Joker somehow returns to terrorize Gotham. How? To say any more would be to spoil a movie so mature and shocking it was heavily edited before releasing (the original version is now widely available, however).</p><h2 id=h-1-blight data-injectable=false>1. Blight</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/blight-batman-beyond-e1708514948168.jpg><p data-characters=576 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=false>If Terry McGinnis is the Spider-Man of Batmen then who should his arch-nemesis be? Why, his own answer to the Green Goblin, obviously. Enter Derek Powers AKA Blight, a very Norman Osborn-alike business magnate who has taken over Wayne Enterprises. In a twist on the Goblin character, though, the handsome Powers is just a mask for his true ghoulish, radioactive form. Blight served as the main antagonist of the show’s first season and has proved so popular he’s crossed over into the comics. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">If there ever was a Batman Beyond movie</a>, expect the villain to be him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmmZ6rpGKvosDMmqVmmpWuvK%2BwjK%2BgpaSRnru0edGapaSdlGQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./which-hep-alien-members-played-instruments-in-real-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Which Hep Alien Members Played Instruments in Real Life?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-samantha-ponder-american-sports-commentator.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Samantha Ponder American Sports Commentator</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
