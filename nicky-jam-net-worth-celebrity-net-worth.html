Nicky Jam has had numerous hit singles since first coming onto the scene in 1995, including "Travesuras," "X," "El Amante," and "Hasta el Amanecer." He became especially well-known globally after he sang and performed the song "Live It Up", which was the theme of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Nicky Jam has worked with <a title="Daddy Yankee Net Worth" href=#>Daddy Yankee</a> among many other popular artists during his career. The two perform as a duo called Los Cangris. As an actor, Jam has appeared in the films "XXX: Return of Xander Cage" and "Bad Boys for Life," and played himself in the Netflix biographical drama series "Nicky Jam: El Ganador."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Nicky Jam, whose real name is Nick Rivera Caminero, was born on March 17, 1981 in Lawrence, Massachusetts to a Puerto Rican father and Dominican mother. When he was 10, he moved with his family to San Juan, Puerto Rico due to his father's attempt to escape a drug-related offense. Although he had never spoken Spanish before and had a hard time adjusting to the culture, Caminero eventually acclimated by getting into reggaeton music and Caribbean hip hop. Originally, he went by the stage name Nick MC, but changed it to Nicky Jam when he was called that by a homeless man.</p><h2 id=career-beginnings><strong>Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>While working at a discount grocery store when he was 11, Jam passed the time by rapping about the items he was bagging. This caught the attention of a customer, who subsequently invited him to record with a local independent record label. Jam went on to release his debut EP, "…Distinto a los demás," at the age of 14 in 1995. As his popularity grew, he met his idol Daddy Yankee, with whom he formed the music duo Los Cangris. In Puerto Rico, the duo had hits with the singles "En la Cama," "Guayando," and "Donde Estan Las Gatas," among others. Meanwhile, Jam released his second EP, "Haciendo escante," in 2001.</p><h2 id=career-struggles><strong>Career Struggles</strong></h2><p>With Jam's newfound popularity came some serious personal struggles, especially in relation to substance addiction. Having used cocaine since he was 15, he fell into a dangerous drug habit that also included the use of percocet. Jam's substance problems caused major tensions between him and Daddy Yankee, resulting in their bitter split in 2004. This led Jam into a deep depression, during which time he gained substantial weight and got into various legal troubles. To make a living, he performed lounge music at a hotel.</p><h2 id=studio-albums-hit-singles><strong>Studio Albums and Hit Singles</strong></h2><p>Jam released his first studio album, "Vida escante," in 2004. Three years later, he moved to Medellín, Colombia to get himself back on track after his struggles with substance abuse and depression. He subsequently released his album "The Black Carpet." After suffering a near-fatal overdose in 2010, Jam swore off drugs entirely. He went on to rehabilitate his career in 2014 with his hit singles "Travesuras" and "Voy a Beber." The next year, he had a smash hit with the song "El Perdón," a collaboration with <a href=# title="Enrique Iglesias Net Worth">Enrique Iglesias</a>. Jam had another monster success in 2016 with "Hasta el Amanecer," which became his first song to hit one billion views on YouTube.</p><p>In early 2017, Jam released his third studio album, "Fénix."

Jam continued his success in 2018 with the single "X," a collaboration with J Balvin. The single was featured on his fourth studio album, "Íntimo," which came out in 2019. Two years after that, Jam released the album "Infinity."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-250220 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/GettyImages-869240072.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-250220 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=style-influences><strong>Style and Influences</strong></h2><p>Jam performs in the reggaeton and Latin trap genres.
