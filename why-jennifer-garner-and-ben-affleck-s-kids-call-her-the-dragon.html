The couple has three kids: &nbsp;Violet, 18, Fin, 15, and Samuel, 12. While Ben Affleck’s current marital struggles with Jennifer Lopez have dominated the headlines, he’s often seen spending time with his children in Los Angeles.</p><p id=par-3_33>Affleck might be a fun parent compared to Garner. <span>In</span> 2020, while speaking on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a>, Garner explained that her kids call her “the dragon” because of her strict rules.</p><p id=par-4_26>“If you’re like me, I kill the fun,” Garner admitted. “I am so lame. They call me the dragon; they have all these names for me.”</p><p id=par-5_25>Because Garner always tells her kids “no,” she says that one day a year, she “says yes” to any request. She calls it “Yes Day.”</p><p id=par-6_23>“Yes. We want pizza with ice cream for breakfast, or with toothpaste. Yeah,” she laughed. “I do it. Yes, I have for years.”</p><p id=par-7_46>Garner noted that her kids have different ideas of what “Yes Day” entails because of their age differences. “They have to agree, because it’s just one day,” she explained. “So, the one thing that they can agree on is basically making an a** out of me.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ben-affleck-said-it-was-hard-and-stressful-to-parent-post-divorce>Ben Affleck said it was ‘hard and stressful’ to parent post-divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ben-Affleck-Jennifer-Garner-3.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-8_55>Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck continue to put their kids first in their lives post-divorce. The exes remain friendly and regularly see each other in 2024, with Affleck frequently stopping by Garner’s home. However, transitioning from married to divorced parents wasn’t easy for Affleck. Affleck told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a> that being a divorced, working dad presented challenges.</p><p id=par-9_83>“So, I’m trying to fit a whole week of dad into three and a half days, [it’s] hard and stressful,” he said in 2021. “My standards really changed. I don’t want to go travel and do something if it’s not really rewarding and meaningful. Yeah, I have to work. The kids know I have to work. Their mom has to work. They understand that. But it’s not like I’m some martyr for my kids. I get more out of it than anything else.”</p><p id=par-10_65>Despite the challenges, Affleck maintains that Garner is a fantastic mother. “Jen is a superhero mom,” he said in 2016, a year after their split and two years before finalizing their divorce. “She is an amazing mother and I’m really lucky to have her as a partner to co-parent these kids with. We try our best, we put them first and that’s what we do.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-garner-wants-her-ex-husband-to-be-happy-and-healthy-for-the-kids-despite-marital-woes>Jennifer Garner wants her ex-husband to be ‘happy and healthy’ for the kids despite marital woes</h2><p id=par-11_58>Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez continue to dominate the media with divorce rumors.
