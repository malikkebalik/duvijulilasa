Wearing her heart on her sleeve, Swift has allowed herself the gift of chasing her heart’s desires, and that means that she’s allowed her heart to find joy in different relationships throughout her time in the public eye.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>Swift’s love story hinges on her saying yes and shaking it off when love comes to an end; her ability to know all too well when things aren’t quite enchanted has resulted in those heart eyes and butterflies-in-the-stomach bonds turning sour, and knowing when it’s time to walk away. Some might say that she’s got a torrid love affair with romance as a whole, but we think she’s just a woman who follows her heart and embraces the magic the journey brings.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Finding romance with the likes of <strong>Harry Styles</strong> and <strong>John Mayer</strong> to <strong>Tom Hiddleston</strong> and <strong>Joe Jonas</strong>, Swift’s dating history includes other men in entertainment with good reason — often, celebrities find one another in their similar social circles, and understanding the way the business works; these relationships can work out quite well. Of course, that doesn’t mean that they’ll all be perfect bonds in the end.</p><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>In 2017, Swift and actor <strong>Joe Alwyn</strong> went public with their relationship and stayed the course for six years, before breaking up in April 2023. The pair had quite the journey together, and fans thought Swift may have found her happily ever after with him, but when news of their separation was made public, tears fell from her eyes as she crooned songs that fans felt were written with him in mind. In the months since the pair separated, Swift has been linked to new romances, but just who is she (allegedly) seeing now?</p><h2 id=h-swift-is-back-in-the-bleachers data-injectable=false>Swift is back in the bleachers</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NFL (@nfl)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>Swift’s catchy tune “You Belong With Me” is embedded into the brain of anyone who has ever longed for someone to look their way and see more than the friend who is always there. One of its most famous lines deals with cheering, bleachers, and athletes; so it comes as no surprise that the song is once again the talk of Swifties everywhere.</p><p>“She’s Cheer Captain, and I’m on the bleachers<br>Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find<br>That what you’re looking for has been here the whole time”</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>When Swift was first tied to Kansas City Chiefs’ <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Travis Kelce</a></strong>, fans had hearts in their eyes for the pair. The Chiefs’ tight end went to Taylor’s concert at Arrowhead Stadium this summer, but wasn’t able to give her the friendship bracelet he made her with his number on it. So when he took a shot and asked her to come to see him rock the stadium next, she delivered.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Appearing at two Chiefs’ games now, Swift has been cheering Kelce on with excitement and passion; honestly, we’re happy for her. She’s young, living the dream, and nothing says she has to be tied down to one person just yet. When Kelce and Swift rode off together in a limo after the first game she attended, we had all the feels for her.</p><p data-characters=428 data-current-count=785 data-injectable=false>While things aren’t reported to be serious between the two just yet, it’s adorable to watch her at his games, and it’s just as charming to see the camera pan to him as he looks up at her in the stadium. Time will only tell what the future looks like for these two, but Swift’s blank space seems to have Kelce’s name written all over it right now, and we’re having fun watching it all unfold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmrJGuubC%2BjKyuop6kYrGiwMinnmamn6x8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition Review</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-riley-curry-meet-steph-curry-s-daughter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Riley Curry Meet Steph Currys Daughter</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
