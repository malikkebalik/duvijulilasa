In fact, their first clash is one every Star Wars fan needs to see.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>From 2003-2005, Genndy Tartakovsky, the man to thank for iconic hits like Dexter’s Laboratory and Samurai Jack, developed the first animated iteration of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clone Wars</a>. Finally, fans received a glimpse into the fabled conflict first mentioned in New Hope.</p><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=857 data-injectable=true>Tartakovsky’s Clone Wars came out a year after&nbsp;Attack of the Clones&nbsp;and held Star Wars fans over until&nbsp;Revenge of the Sith&nbsp;arrived in 2005. The series, comprised of 25 short episodes, bridged the two movies and introduced fans to some incredible villains like the Sith assassin Asajj Ventress and Durge, whose regenerative abilities put Wolverine to shame! The series, enhanced by Tartakovsky’s popular minimalist style, also made villains like General Grievous ten times more terrifying than their live-action counterparts. Seriously, Grievous is a slasher villain in this show!</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Tartakovsky’s art worked amazingly well with lightsaber combat. The swordsmanship in the series is spectacular; each duel is well-layered with slick fineness and explosive energy — no duel moreso than Anakin vs. Asajj Ventress.</p><h2 id=h-anakin-skywalker-vs-asajj-ventress-is-the-perfect-lightsaber-duel data-injectable=false>Anakin Skywalker vs. Asajj Ventress is the perfect lightsaber duel</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Untitled-design-77-1.png><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>Season 2 of Star Wars: The Clone Wars delivers a three-episode arc that features a prolonged showdown between Padawan Anakin Skywalker and Sith apprentice Asajj Ventress. The two clash on Yavin 4 after the latter brutally eliminates the Clone squadron accompanying the Jedi. She even destroys Anakin’s astromech droid! The planet’s dense forests and jungles serve as the perfect location for what ensues.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>After the swift slaughter of the troopers, Ventress walks through fire and reveals herself. “I am going to make you pay for what you’ve done,” Anakin coldly states. “Come, Padawan. Your fall will be my ascension to the Sith.” Let the epic duel begin!</p><p data-characters=664 data-current-count=944 data-injectable=true>The two charge and immediately ditch their robes. They exchange swift strikes and Force pushes, with Anakin forced to dodge and chop multiple chunks of wood thrown his way. Just when the Padawan disarms his foe, she retreats up to the trees. He follows. In these significant moments, the music cuts, and all the viewer is left with is eerie near-silence, hearing only the natural sounds of the environment. When the two Force-wielders clash, it’s energic and powerful. However, the moments when Ventress is hiding and stalking Anakin help this fight stand out from other lightsaber duels. Truly, nobody in animation uses near-silence like Genndy Tartakovsky.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>The momentum consistently shifts between Anakin and Ventress. It’s also evident early on that the Padawan is using a traditional, fluid, and acrobatic Jedi style against his foe. However, as the battle rages on, Anakin’s strikes grow more singular and wild. The animators beautifully portray his anger gradually rising as the fight progresses, and it’s amazing.</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=646 data-injectable=true>The showdown eventually reaches an ancient Sith temple (not before Anakin has to endure stones getting flung directly into his torso and face — ouch.) After an epic staredown, rain begins pouring, and the sound of the droplets hitting the lightsabers is just great.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>By the time the duel reaches inside the temple, it’s less Anakin and more Vader that Ventress is up against. She is forced on the backfoot by the aggressive Padawan. The Sith apprentice gets overwhelmed to the point of needing to contend with a massive stone column getting Force pushed her way. Things become even more dire for Ventress when she tries to Force push a charging Anakin away; the Padawan simply tanks it like an absolute juggernaut.</p><p data-characters=723 data-current-count=723 data-injectable=true>The duel’s climax takes place atop the temple, with a red moon in the background. Ventress remains on the backfoot and Anakin presses forward with powerful lunging strikes. Although Asajj is able to disarm him, Anakin simply grabs her wrist with his robotic hand — and squeezes until she drops her saber. The Padawan then attacks with her own weapon until Ventress is on her knees, barely able to defend. Anakin’s strikes are so powerful that the earth beneath their feet literally crumbles. After each attack, blue and green flashes of Qui-Gon Jinn, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoda</a>, and Obi-Wan are seen watching on. Quickly, the ground is torn apart and Ventress falls into the void. Anakin roars and tosses her weapon into the abyss.</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=289 data-injectable=false>This is arguably the greatest conclusion to any lightsaber duel portrayed in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars</a> franchise. This fight has everything: well-timed Force pushes, using it to hurl hefty objects, utilizing the environment to one’s advantage, kicks to the face, fancy swordsmanship, everything.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=false>The duel also accomplished the story it needed to tell: throughout Anakin Skywalker’s rise, there was a darkness growing in him, and it only needed to be tugged at for it to explode. And it did it in less than ten minutes. Bravo, Tartakovsky. Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yiusCkoKdlo6DGuK3LpJyrZaaoeqK%2FwKOhZq6Vo8GzsdKsZK2glWKzqrPHrWSerpWnxm6%2F05qpZq%2BRp8BussCnZKedlZnAbsDOZq6arJOdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./buckle-up-kaitlyn-bristowe-issues-charity-lawson-warning-about-dancing-with-the-stars-p.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Buckle up: Kaitlyn Bristowe issues Charity Lawson warning about Dancing With the Stars p</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-winslet-was-terrified-of-alan-rickman-when-she-met-him-and-thought-i-m-going-to-die.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title></p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
