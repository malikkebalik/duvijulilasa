Though her character starts off relatively lovable, a series of questionable decisions led fans to have contrasting opinions about her. Choices like cheating on her PSATs, cheating on Pacey, and failing to support her brother, Jack, when he first came out certainly didn’t endear <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawson’s Creek</a> fans to Andie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dawsons-Creek-cast.jpg><p id=par-2_92>Though Andie wasn’t one of the “core four” characters that<a href=#> Dawson’s Creek</a> premiered with, she had a huge role from the time that she was introduced in Season 2 until her ultimate exit in Season 4. But what was it like for Meredith Monroe to come into a show a season late when the cast had already bonded? At 29, Monroe was much older than most of her fellow actors. Still, she quickly got close to her castmates even though Katie Holmes initially gave her a hard time as a joke.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meredith-monroe-reflects-on-joining-the-cast-of-dawson-s-creek>Meredith Monroe reflects on joining the cast of ‘Dawson’s Creek’</h2><p id=par-3_101>“I got there and Josh [Jackson] and James [Van Der Beek] were amazing, Michelle [Williams] was amazing, but Katie totally gave it to me,” Monroe recalled about her Dawson’s Creek tenure in a 2018 interview with &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a>. “[Holmes] said, ‘Oh yeah, you know we had somebody come in last year and they were going to be a new series regular, but we got rid of them after one or two episodes.’ I was like, ‘What?’ She said, ‘I’m just kidding! What do you want to drink?’ and I was like, ‘Oh my god, my heart just stopped. Gimme a second!’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_59>During the reunion interview, Monroe also shared that she felt very fortunate that <a href=#>Dawson’s Creek </a>filmed in Wilmington, North Carolina rather than New York or Los Angeles. The actor added that the cast was able to truly bond and become a kind of family. But if Monroe loved playing Andie so much, why was she booted off the show?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-was-andie-written-off-the-show-in-season-4>Why was Andie written off the show in Season 4?</h2><p id=par-5_102>In a separate conversation with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a> Kevin Williamson, who created Dawson’s Creek, insinuated that Andie got written off the show because the writers didn’t know how to save her character or take her in a different direction. This saddened Williamson, so when returned to write the series finale, he knew there was an opportunity to redeem her character. He ended up writing a scene where Andie, who is completing her doctoral residency, visits Jen in the hospital. She also has a scene with Pacey where he is able to express how much she, as his first love, meant to him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_61>“I wasn’t thrilled with the way Andie left the show because I really loved that character when she first came on,” the Dawson’s Creek creator shared. “And by the time she left, everyone hated her. I didn’t think the audience needed to turn against her the way they did. That’s why I wanted to bring her back for the series finale.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-was-andie-edited-out-of-the-dawson-s-creek-series-finale>Why was Andie edited out of the ‘Dawson’s Creek’ series finale?</h2><p id=par-7_57>Williamson was able to bring back Monroe to film the scenes. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, Monroe’s scenes got completely cut out of the series finale. However, the scenes with Andie are included in the DVD version of the finale for fans of Dawson’s Creek who are clamoring for some resolution and justice for Andie’s character.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxosPSqKWsZZOnsqa3jLCfsmWRo7GqsYycrK1lo5q%2FqrHSZp2ippGhsm%2B006ajaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ant-man-fans-feel-dumb-after-only-just-discovering-the-hidden-secret-of-quantumania.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ant-Man fans feel dumb after only just discovering the hidden secret of Quantumania</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-bill-murray-did-the-garfield-movie-and-sequel.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Bill Murray Did the 'Garfield' Movie and Sequel</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./anita-hill-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html>Anita Hill Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-documents-allegedly-reveal-hidden-offshore-fortunes-of-vladimir-putin-s-inner-circle.html>Leaked Documents Allegedly Reveal Hidden Offshore Fortunes Of Vladimir Putin's Inner Circle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./taylor-kitsch-wiki-actor-bio-age-wife-family-career-net-worth.html>Taylor Kitsch: Wiki (Actor), Bio, Age, Wife, Family, Career, Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-10-best-arcane-characters-ranked.html>The 10 best Arcane characters, ranked</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-harry-kane-katie-goodland-pregnant-children-age-gap-and-family.html>Is Harry Kane Katie Goodland Pregnant?
